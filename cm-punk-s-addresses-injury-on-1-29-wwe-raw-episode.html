Since then, he has highlighted his goal which is to finally main event WrestleMania.</p><p>Since his return, Punk has engaged in onscreen promos with many of his contemporaries such as Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre, and even Cody Rhodes. His plans to main event WrestleMania were going to start at the Royal Rumble.</p><p>He entered the Royal Rumble match in the 27th spot and was the final two men before he was eliminated by the <a href=#>eventual winner Cody Rhodes</a>. Following the Rumble, it was reported that <a href=#>CM Punk suffered torn tricep injury</a> and <a href=#>he was most likely going to be out of action for 4-6 months following surgery</a>.</p><p>Tonight on RAW, CM Punk kicked off the show to address the fans regarding his injury. He started off by acknowledging Cody Rhodes who won the Royal Rumble match. He even congratulated Cody on his win.</p><p>CM Punk then stated that he injured his right tricep during the match and while he wants to compete, his dream of main eventing WrestleMania isn’t going to happen. Punk then said that this injury is nothing but a flesh wound and he will bounce back. He then said that WrestleMania 40 is not in the cards but there is always next year.</p><p>This is when Drew McIntyre interrupted him. Drew said that he was praying that this happened to Punk and his prayer was answered. Drew also said that he slept like a baby after hearing about Punk’s injury. Drew then mentioned that he was going to find a way to main event WrestleMania and live CM Punk’s dream again. CM Punk then told Drew that he would be back and main event WrestleMania but before that happened he was coming for Drew McIntyre.</p><p>Drew tried to cheap shot Punk who tried fighting back but McIntyre hit him with the Glasgow kiss before he stomped his arm. Sami Zayn then came out and brawled with McIntyre who retreated from the ring.</p><p>It looks like CM Punk will have to hit the pause button on his dream of main eventing WrestleMania. We wish him the best and hope to see him back in the ring again soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What are your thoughts on CM Punk’s injury?
