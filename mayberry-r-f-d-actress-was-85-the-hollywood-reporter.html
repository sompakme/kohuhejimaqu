She was 85.</p><p>Golonka died early Monday morning in her sleep at a memory care facility in West Hollywood after a battle with Alzheimer’s,&nbsp;her niece Stephanie Morton-Millstein told The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>Early in her career, Golonka shared a New York apartment with <a href=# rel=noopener>Valerie Harper</a>&nbsp;and played hookers on Broadway in Take Me Along&nbsp;and Kirk Douglas’&nbsp;One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. She also was the object of two brothers’ affection in Neil Simon’s first play,&nbsp;Come Blow Your Horn.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>She portrayed another prostitute opposite Clint Eastwood in&nbsp;Hang ‘Em High&nbsp;(1968) and was the wife of a CIA agent (Peter Falk) in&nbsp;The In-Laws&nbsp;(1979).</p><p>Golonka was introduced as Millie Hutchins during the eighth and final season (1967-68) of CBS’&nbsp;The Andy Griffith Show. Her sweet, carefree character becomes engaged to county clerk Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson), but a long train trip on the way to the wedding makes it obvious they shouldn’t marry.</p><p>When the spinoff&nbsp;Mayberry R.F.D.&nbsp;premiered in September 1968, Golonka’s character was now named Millie Swanson and dating Sam Jones (series star <a href=# rel=noopener>Ken Berry</a>), the head of the town council. She remained on that show for all three of its seasons.</p><p>Golonka also had three memorable guest-starring stints on other CBS comedies in the early ’70s. She played Betty Bowerchuck, the daughter of Chuckles the Clown and the girlfriend of Ted Knight, on&nbsp;The Mary Tyler Moore Show; the accident-prone Nurse Eddie on&nbsp;M*A*S*H; and an escort of one of Archie’s old pals (Larry Storch) on&nbsp;All in the Family.</p><p>Arlene Leanore Golonka was born in Chicago on Jan. 23, 1936. She studied at the Goodman Theatre in her hometown.</p><p>She came to New York and worked as a waitress before landing a part on Broadway in 1958 in&nbsp;The Night Circus. However, she had to return to her diner gig when the drama, starring Ben Gazzara and his wife, Janice Rule, closed after just seven performances.</p><p>Golonka found more security in her next Broadway outing, the musical comedy&nbsp;Take Me Along, which starred Jackie Gleason and Robert Morse and ran for 14 months through December 1960.</p><p>In 1961, she starred in&nbsp;Come Blow Your Horn, playing Peggy Evans (Jill St. John’s role in the 1963 movie version), then portrayed Candy Starr in&nbsp;One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest&nbsp;from November 1963 until January 1964.</p><p>From 1964-66, she was in the Broadway comedies&nbsp;Ready When You Are, C.B.!, directed by Joshua Logan, and&nbsp;The Wayward Stork.</p><p>Around this time, she shared an apartment on West 101st Street and Riverside Drive with Harper, then a dancer on Broadway, and three other women; it was Golonka who encouraged Harper to try acting.</p><p>Golonka played several characters on a 1965 comedy album,&nbsp;You Don’t Have to Be Jewish,&nbsp;which soared to No. 9 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;charts. When she couldn’t do the follow-up record, she recommended Harper for the job.</p><p>Meanwhile, Golonka was appearing on television on&nbsp;Naked City,&nbsp;Car 54, Where Are You?&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Doctors&nbsp;and in such films as&nbsp;Love With the Proper Stranger&nbsp;(1963) and Arthur Hiller’s&nbsp;Penelope&nbsp;(1966), starring Natalie Wood.
