Theirs was a turbulent relationship, and after he divorced Margaret, Snowdon went on to marry the woman he'd had an affair with, Lucy Lindsay-Hogg (they divorced 22 years later, in 2000). As for Llewellyn, the only person in the love triangle still alive today, he and Margaret dated for eight years, and remained friends after an amicable breakup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dfkzDaxy3nMKZKCufHkxkW-1920-80.jpg><p>It's thought that Margaret gave her blessing when Llewellyn married, and remained close to both Llewellyn and his new wife.</p><p>Even the Queen has reportedly weighed in on how much healthier Princess Margaret's relationship with Llewellyn was, in contrast to her explosive relationship with Lord Snowdon, noting at Margaret's funeral&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a29613469/who-is-roddy-llewellyn-the-crown-season-3/>how happy Llewellyn made her.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cCAZXUcs6aRjjivKsL54bf-1920-80.jpg><p>But back to those photos. Taken in Mustique in 1976 roughly three years after the pair first met, they're candid by today's standards, but were enough to spark a royal frenzy (pun intended) and lead to Lord Snowdon separating from, and then divorcing Margaret, (which, by all accounts, the princess was<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.biography.com/news/princess-margaret-love-life referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>&nbsp;absolutely fine with</a>).</p><p>Here's Llewellyn en route to the airport to Mustique in 1976:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KRQM3W9bjZRqbWf4ZXjCdm-1920-80.jpg><p>Llewellyn in the waters of Mustique:</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Nonetheless, the release of the photographs forced Margaret and Llewellyn into a tough spot, with Llewellyn offering a mortified statement to the press that did not comment specifically on the photos but claimed that he was, in fact, just gardening in Mustique. (He was, and remains, a gardening expert.)</p><p>"I am not prepared to comment on any of the events of last week. I much regret any embarrassment caused to Her Majesty the Queen and the royal family, for whom I wish to express the greatest respect, admiration and loyalty," it read. "I thank my own family for their confidence and support, and I am very grateful for the help of my friends at the farm who, with myself, share a common interest in restoring a house to its original order and beauty, and in farming land which it is hoped will provide food for our Parsenn Sally restaurant in Bath. Could we please be permitted by the media, who have besieged us, to carry on with our work and private lives without further interference."</p><p><strong>Spoilers for season three.&nbsp;</strong>Season three of&nbsp;The Crown&nbsp;does, indeed, pay close attention to the relationship between Llewellyn and Margaret, and in particular the fallout from the photos of the two of them hitting the press. There's a real "before" and "after" sense to the storyline: Llewellyn and Margaret meet at a pool party and hit it off immediately, sparking a love affair that leaves Margaret remarking, absent-mindedly, that this is the first time in her life that she's ever really been happy. Their romance is tender and their holidaying idyllic—and then a photographer sneaks up on the two and snaps a few photos, and it's all downhill from there.</p><p><strong>Trigger warning: The following paragraph continues an allusion to suicide.&nbsp;</strong>Notably, the photographs that were in the newspapers (above) are actually very tame compared to the "photos" the photographer is shown to take, which reveal Llewellyn and Margaret's easy intimacy while relaxing on the beach. (There's also a callback to that Union Jack swimsuit, you'll be glad to hear—Margaret drags Llewellyn to a store and cajoles him into trying it on.) But Margaret is a married royal, and in both the show and real life, the fallout is tremendous. In the show, the photos trigger a depressive spell, and&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a29637598/did-princess-margaret-overdose-the-crown/>Margaret tries to kill herself.</a>&nbsp;And while the latter is, sadly, based in truth, Margaret's secretary has gone on the record to say that the photos also caused Lord Snowdon to file for divorce, which pleased Margaret.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a29613469/who-is-roddy-llewellyn-the-crown-season-3/>I quote:</a>&nbsp;"Thank you, Nigel.
