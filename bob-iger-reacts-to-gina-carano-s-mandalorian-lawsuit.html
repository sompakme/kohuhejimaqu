It’s backed by Elon Musk, who is helping fund the suit through X. CNBC asked Iger what his thoughts were on Musk backing the suit — and potentially others like it against his company.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“None,” Iger said flatly.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Carano is suing&nbsp;<a href=#>Disney</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Lucasfilm</a>&nbsp;for discrimination and wrongful termination. She alleges she was fired for voicing right-wing opinions on social media. Iger made the comments ahead of The Walt Disney Co.’s fourth quarter earnings call with investors on Wednesday.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Musk has since tweeted thoughts such as “Disney sucks” (reacting to a post claiming the studio is considering The Bear Emmy-winner Ayo Edebiri as a replacement for Johnny Depp in Pirates 6) and posted an alleged Disney inclusion standards document and <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote</a>, “An anonymous source just sent me this from Disney. It is mandatory, institutionalized racism and sexism!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Last year, Musk pledged to fund legal action for users on X who claim they have faced discrimination by their employers over their activity on the platform. The offer came with “no limit” on costs, with Musk saying he would “go after the boards of directors of the companies too.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In November, Musk told off advertisers like Disney who boycott his platform due to his controversial or offensive posts, saying, “If someone is going to try to blackmail me with advertising? Blackmail me with money? Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself, is that clear? Hey, Bob, if you’re in the audience. That’s how I feel, don’t advertise.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Carano was fired in 2021 following a slew of right-wing social media posts, including one that read, “most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a href=#>According to the complaint</a>, Disney and Lucasfilm harassed and defamed Carano for refusing to conform with their viewpoints on issues relating to Black Lives Matter, preferred pronouns and disproven claims of election interference. While she was allegedly fired for her cultural and religious beliefs, Carano argues that the entertainment giant turned a blind eye to her male co-stars, who allegedly made offensive and denigrating posts directed toward Republicans. She points to Pedro Pascal’s 2017 post comparing former President Donald Trump to Hitler.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At one point, Carano was told to meet with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and 45 employees who identify as LGBTQ+, according to the suit. She declined and was terminated shortly after from&nbsp;The Mandalorian, as well as other titles in the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;universe, including&nbsp;Rangers of the New Republic.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Winston Cho contributed to this report.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOm6abZZmcsrN5xqKlmmWTlr%2Bius5mpJqmlJa5sL7ImqVmpJGswLa102Zoa2tlbX55hI9yZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cobra-kai-season-6-release-date-when-is-cobra-kai-season-6-coming-out.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cobra Kai Season 6 Release Date When Is Cobra Kai Season 6 Coming Out?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./angie-poirier-husband-age-height-salary-wikipedia-instagram-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Angie Poirier Husband, Age, Height, Salary, Wikipedia, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
