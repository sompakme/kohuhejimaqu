So: Who is Riley Roberts, the private and fiercely supportive husband-to-be to one of the most up-and-coming politicians in the United States?</p><h2 id=how-did-aoc-and-riley-meet-3>How did AOC and Riley meet?</h2><p>A 2018&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vogue.com/article/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-interview-vogue-november-2018-issue referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Vogue</a>&nbsp;profile on Ocasio-Cortez described Roberts as an "easygoing redhead" and explains that he's been supportive of her for a long time:</p><p>Then there’s Roberts, whom Ocasio-Cortez met—“in true nerdy fashion,” she says—at a weekly Friday-afternoon conversation hosted by the dean at BU. He later moved from Arizona to be with her. When I first met him backstage at&nbsp;The Daily Show, he was casually citing tax rates in the 1950s.</p><p>At these Coffee & Conversations meetings at BU, according to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.insider.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-partner-riley-roberts-avoids-the-spotlight-2019-7 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Insider</a>, Ocasio-Cortez often drove the sessions. A college friend told the publication that she would often end the meetings "with thoughtful conclusions that included 'her own twist' on the subject."</p><p>On the other hand, Roberts liked to keep quiet. "You could see him in the corner of the room really thinking through things," said a mutual college friend of the couple to&nbsp;Insider, who described him as "philosopher" type.

He also worked as a consultant to help tech startups grow revenue using marketing and development. He hails from Boston, Massachusetts, with a dual degree from Boston University.</p><p>Back in February, conservative podcast host Luke Thompson&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/ltthompso/status/1096407285851713537 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>tweeted</a>&nbsp;a picture of Roberts's email, claiming in the caption that the freshman representative was paying Roberts to be a member of her staff, "drawing a salary on the taxpayer's dime." Ocasio-Cortez hopped on social media to provide a reality check: "Actually this cal designation is a permission so he can have access to my Google Cal,"&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1096420134435123201 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>replied</a>&nbsp;Ocasio-Cortez. "Congressional spouses get Gcal access all the time. Next time check your facts before you tweet nonsense."</p><h2 id=did-riley-attend-aoc-apos-s-swearing-in-3>Did Riley attend AOC's swearing-in?</h2><p>Yes! Roberts was there with Ocasio-Cortez's brother Gabriel (black suit and glasses) and her mother Blanca (who held the Bible for her daughter). Roberts is the tall, bearded gentleman at the far right who was literally beaming from ear to ear in support of his history-making girlfriend.</p><p>Roberts also gave his reactions briefly to the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://nypost.com/2019/01/03/ocasio-cortez-says-gotta-run-when-asked-about-shutdown-pay/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>New York Post</a>: "A really incredible day, really special."

In the award-winning documentary (which follows the 2018 primary campaigns of Ocasio-Cortez, Amy Vilela, Cori Bush, and Paula Jean Swearengin), many got a proper glimpse at the superstar progressive's leading man (at 0:35 in this video), and they were surprised enough by Roberts's look to take to Twitter to share their two cents.</p><p>Several comments about her boyfriend's aesthetic started rolling in post watching&nbsp;Knock Down the House, and one from political journalist Marie Le Conte started a mean, somewhat funny meme.</p><p>In a&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-boyfriend-riley-roberts-bin-raccoon-095928880.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>now-deleted tweet</a>, she wrote, "Apologies for the blatantly mean tweet but THIS is what AOC's boyfriend looks like? Incredible scenes, truly representing all the ambitious and stunning millennial women shackled to boyfriends who look like bin raccoons out there."</p><p>In the end, the couple had the last laugh; Ocasio-Cortez took it to her Instagram stories to say the jokes on Twitter inspired her boyfriend to get that post-election haircut.</p><p>"The internet roasted Riley into getting a haircut/glow-up after&nbsp;Knock Down the House," Ocasio-Cortez captioned the video of Roberts post-haircut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ifmWXhnxnsbdz7X24dGE6F-1920-80.jpg><p>Ocasio-Cortez explained on Twitter that because they were so busy with the election, the couple hadn't "gotten a haircut in months."&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-has-aoc-apos-s-family-said-about-riley-3>What has AOC's family said about Riley?</h2><p>In perhaps the most Mom move I've ever witnessed, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a26099099/who-is-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-mom-blanca/>Ocasio-Cortez's mom Blanca </a>gave a gushing interview in 2019 to the&nbsp;Daily Mail&nbsp;about how much she wants the pair to get engaged.

"They've been together for four years now, after they reconnected from a college breakup. I know they love children, and they do very well with children from the family. So, I hope they get married soon." She added—and I giggled at this part most of all—"Although they haven't told me anything about their plans."</p><p>Perhaps in a nod to why Ocasio-Cortez keeps her personal life private, Blanca added: "'I don't like the limelight for myself and my family. But it seems that God played quite a joke on me with this politics stuff."</p><h2 id=what-else-do-we-know-about-riley-and-aoc-3>What else do we know about Riley and AOC?</h2><p>Ocasio-Cortez has mentioned that she's considered freezing her eggs.

Can I afford to do that?...My orthodontist was telling me about how she was doing IVF, and I’m, like, asking her what her experience is like.”</p><p>In the meantime, Ocasio-Cortez is happy with dog motherhood. Last January, she shared a short video of the little French bulldog she and Roberts had adopted, saying, "Hey boo boo! Hi, welcome to our family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jcftJEvTcqxF6K6oZumX4e-1920-80.png><p>In May of 2022, Ocasio-Cortez confirmed that she and Roberts were engaged, telling Insider: "We got engaged last month in my family's hometown in Puerto Rico.
