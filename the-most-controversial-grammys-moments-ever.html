This doesn’t happen to people like me very often." Fans, quickly honing in on the fact that the Grammys has historically awarded many white men, took umbrage.</p><h2 id=blue-ivy-shushes-her-parents-3>Blue Ivy Shushes Her Parents</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HS6HsqAvM6jFDcsSUtMrEF-1920-80.jpg><p>It might be intimidating to have two parents as talented and famous as Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

Poor SZA was on crutches and had to be helped take the stage. And Doja Cat, who had been in the bathroom, had to come rushing on stage a few minutes later. "Listen.

He beat out Frank Sinatra! (He would also go on to win an Oscar, but his following albums weren't as successful.)</p><h2 id=m-i-a-performs-pregnant-3>M.I.A.

(As a formerly pregnant person, I applaud her decision as much as I am mystified by how she pulled it off.) She was also supposed to perform at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/oscars/>the Oscars</a>, but by then she had (unsurprisingly) given birth.</p><h2 id=elton-and-eminem-perform-3>Elton and Eminem Perform</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3YgnxnBs5XzDbKBDZBcXQh-1920-80.jpg><p>At the 2001 ceremony, Elton John and Eminem performed "Stan." It was early in the rapper's career, whose lyrics were sometimes homophobic; When <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/rewind-story-behind-eminem-elton-214752946.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>approached</u></a> about the idea, John apparently was interested in order to help break down barriers.

It was a huge news story, and support came pouring in for the singer.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-39-s-egg-3>Lady Gaga's Egg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a6vmCf9Kw4PiK4Lr9GtzVU-1920-80.jpg><p>When you're <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/lady-gaga/>Lady Gaga</a>, it's hard to outdo yourself (hello meat dress!), but arriving to the Grammys in an egg held by latex-clad performers and only coming out onstage has to be up there. She later told British Vogue, “I was in the egg for three days…To be honest, at award shows, especially during this time, I didn’t like to talk to people."</p><h2 id=pink-does-some-serious-aerials-3>Pink Does Some Serious Aerials</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCavaNVrnUrm5VwgYk8MNa-1920-80.jpg><p>By this point, Pink's aerial performances, featuring wire work and a ton of athleticism, are par for the course. But back in 2010 it was shocking. Being held up by wires and sometimes only a sheet (technical term: "aerial tissue"), Pink serenaded the crowd from high in the air. No surprise, people were as delighted as they were surprised.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-39-s-exorcism-3>Nicki Minaj's Exorcism</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4S5GXptFGkuYHfXjaY3UG-1920-80.jpg><p>No stranger to controversy, Nicki Minaj walked the red carpet with an actor dressed as, who else, the Pope. Once onstage to perform “Roman Holiday,” she performed with dancers dressed as monks and priests, then levitated above the stage during a mock-exorcism. The Catholic League, no surprise, was offended.</p><h2 id=helen-reddy-calls-god-a-woman-3>Helen Reddy Calls God a Woman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdkqSjq2PXHsM3e5giEQwK-1920-80.jpg><p>Long before the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/ariana-grande/>Ariana Grande</a> song, there was Helen Reddy. In her win for song "I Am Woman," she thanked then-husband Jeff Wald, "because he makes my success possible," and then thanked God, "because she makes everything possible." It was controversial!</p><h2 id=the-grammys-tie-3>The Grammys Tie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkiWDEkUbxNMbVJoQWq73Y-1920-80.jpg><p>The Grammys have had a few tied categories in its long history. But there's only been one for one of their most prestigious awards (Song of the Year): Barbra Streisand and Paul Williams’s “Evergreen” tied for the award with Joe Brooks’s “You Light up My Life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8T49kzFGPuaVdeLNffN4wK-1920-80.jpg><p>In 2018, post-ceremony during which only one woman received a solo award, Neil Portnow, the president of the Recording Academy, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/arts/music/grammys-step-up-neil-portnow-backlash.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>told reporters </u></a>“women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level” need to “step up.” Surprising almost no one, he faced backlash. He later said his comments were taken out of context and that he meant women face greater barriers and needed more support. "I regret that I wasn’t as articulate as I should have been."</p><h2 id=the-weeknd-accuses-the-grammys-of-being-corrupt-3>The Weeknd Accuses the Grammys of Being Corrupt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kihZ9CiwLAV3LVmRdmN5p5-1920-80.jpg><p>In 2020, after a successful After Hours album, The Weeknd received no Grammy nominations, and tweeted his displeasure. “The Grammys remain corrupt,” he tweeted, adding, “You owe me, my fans and the industry transparency…” [He won again in 2022 as a featured artist on "Hurricane" for Best Melodic Rap Performance.]</p><h2 id=macklemore-beats-kendrick-lamar-3>Macklemore Beats Kendrick Lamar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zFe3ciyhSketNx5cAQ9Agh-1920-80.jpg><p>Macklemore (Ryan Haggerty) and Ryan Lewis won Best Rap Album (Kendrick Lamar was expected to win), and afterwards even Haggerty said he'd wanted Lamar to win. He shared the text he sent Lamar, which said, in part, "You got robbed. I wanted you to win. You should have. It’s weird and sucks that I robbed you. I was gonna say that during the speech. Then the music started playing during my speech, and I froze."</p><h2 id=annie-lennox-39-s-in-drag-3>Annie Lennox's In Drag!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/miiEXqpQGssHx7uqYnKiqY-1920-80.jpg><p>Way before gender fluid dressing was more understood in our society, Annie Lennox took to the stage in 1984 to sing "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" dressed as a man. She later <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/annie-lennox-looks-back-at-drag-grammy-moment-1.366422 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>remembered</u></a> that she scared the crap out of the stage manager (who was terrified because he couldn't find her to go on).</p><h2 id=frank-sinatra-is-cut-off-3>Frank Sinatra Is Cut Off</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vwxVGL4evpBaDspEaLwdyQ-1920-80.jpg><p>At the 1994 ceremony, the guest of honor was none other than Frank Sinatra. But then, several minutes into his speech, CBS cut him off to go to commercial (oops). So Billy Joel, in the middle of his own performance, took a meaningful pause. And he held that pause for a while. It was a sneaky, subtle way to retaliate.</p><h2 id=aretha-franklin-makes-an-impromptu-performance-3>Aretha Franklin Makes an Impromptu Performance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E5fhtMMxBr4vwth82vxmKR-1920-80.jpg><p>In 1998, it was a wild and kind of off-the-rails ceremony. But a shining moment from that night was Aretha Franklin, who stepped in after Luciano Pavarotti canceled last minute, to spontaneously sing in his place (and deliver one of the greatest performances ever, NBD).</p><h2 id=odp-storms-the-stage-3>ODP Storms the Stage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tay4VWQZGk8Vaq5n7TF7z8-1920-80.jpg><p>In the same ceremony, Wu-Tang Clan rapper Ol’ Dirty B****** rushed the stage, kissed presenter Erykah Badu, and protested that they'd lost Best Rap Album to Puff Daddy & the Family. All this, while someone else was being presented for Song of the Year. And he wouldn't be the only crasher—more on that later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nv7ME7TACocpCCR83J4dei-1920-80.jpg><p>The first time the Grammys ceremony recognized Hard Rock/Metal, they chose to favor British rock band Jethro Tull (whom critics argued shouldn't even be in the category) over the masters of the genre, Metallica, who were nominated with one of their best albums. Both bands found it funny, but almost no one else did.</p><h2 id=shelby-lynne-wins-best-new-artist-3>Shelby Lynne Wins Best New Artist</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPWN3qJYCQeuBmRRfaYDz6-1920-80.jpg><p>After a fairly long career, country singer Shelby Lynne won "Best Newcomer," and even she noted that it was a surprising choice.

After losing the Best New Artist Grammy to Evanescence, he crashed their acceptance speech by circling the band, who had gathered at the podium, before being escorted off-stage. After receiving a Hollywood Walk of Fame star over 15 years later, he mentioned it again, so he's still mad about it?</p><h2 id=bob-dylan-is-soy-bombed-3>Bob Dylan is Soy Bombed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SP8ddYVKGvJEgRC2fFFR7a-1920-80.jpg><p>At the infamous 1998 Grammys, Bob Dylan's onstage performance was crashed…by a shirtless dude with the words "Soy Bomb" written on them. Michael Portnoy (a performance artist who was hired as a background extra and went rogue) later explained that it was meant as a "spontaneous explosion of the self."

It was the debate of the decade over who was more well-liked and, critically, who had the better vocals. The solution, in the case of the Grammys, was a win for Aguilera.</p><h2 id=queen-latifah-marries-a-bunch-of-people-3>Queen Latifah Marries a Bunch of People</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4izWevtTcSprL8uDuryiPc-1920-80.jpg><p>Queen Latifah married 34 gay and straight couples while on stage (with stars including Macklemore and Madonna) at the 2014 Grammys.
