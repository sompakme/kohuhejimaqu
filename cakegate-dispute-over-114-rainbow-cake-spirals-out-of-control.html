That’s the problem.”</p><p>She also said she complained because “$84 is a lot of money to me, and I felt ripped off,” in an earlier interview with <i>Today</i>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/content.api.news/v3/images/bin/86383975e5397ac28faf439d345cc1ec width=404 height=720 alt="Rainbow cake dispute spirals out of control" fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>In Ms Allen’s initial viral video, she claimed the customer, Ms Freeman, reached out to order one of the shop’s six-layer rainbow cakes that are covered in multicoloured sprinkles.</p><p>The patron chose the 8-inch cake that serves 18 and goes for $75.99, plus tax.</p><p>“Upon arrival, she seemed to be really surprised that the cake was covered in sprinkles,” Ms Allen stated.</p><p>“We explained to her that all of her signature rainbow cakes are decorated this way and covered in sprinkles.”</p><p>She notes – somewhat sarcastically – that the sweet treats might vary in appearance because she doesn’t “individually place each sprinkle”.</p><p>“She then got super defensive and very rude about the price of the cake, although this is exactly how we decorate all of our rainbow cakes,” Ms Allen said.</p><p>“She even bashed us and put us on her Facebook page.”</p><p>Ms Allen, who also teaches cake-decorating classes, claimed she wasn’t sure “where the confusion was” and argued her time and efforts constitute the price, no matter if the cake came out as expected or not, calling the disgruntled customer “disrespectful”.</p><p>“It’s not disrespectful to expect quality,” Ms Freeman hit back in the text message – a sentiment echoed by social media users who chimed in on the dispute.</p><p>“I’ve bought $40 cakes that look 1000x better,” commented one user.</p><p>“I’d be so embarassed [sic] to claim that work,” another chimed in.</p><p>One speculated that she’d “dropped” the cake and “tried to salvage it because she didn’t want to bake another one”.</p><p>Under the “#CakeGate” hashtag, which has 29 million views, there are numerous clips reviewing the debacle and criticising Ms Allen.</p><p>Some have even alleged she misrepresents her products and services by using stock images or other people’s work to promote her confectionary classes.</p><p>Ms Allen ultimately addressed her critics in a new TikTok video, defending her buttercream confections.</p><p>“I have worked extremely hard to get where I am,” Ms Allen said. “You guys [who] have nothing going on with your life and yourself have so much to say about a situation that you don’t know the full backstory on.</p><p>“I would just keep your mouth shut because it’s not doing anything.”</p><p>She added it was “really hurtful, especially to a small business” when people “just jump on bandwagons”.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>But Ms Freeman doesn’t have much sympathy for the business owner.</p><p>“I feel as if she brought a lot of this on herself,” Ms Freeman told the <i>New York Post</i>.</p><p>“I offered to delete my personal Facebook post and response TikTok but she said she was trying to monetise the situation. She wants us all to keep talking about it.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=TikTok data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>TikTok</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8Wopp1nlZbBcK%2FApJygmaSaeqW10qmsrZ1dpMOmvoytn6KrXaeuqrrBqK5mm5Ggsm6%2Fz6KpmqSjYry2wIyonWabn6PBs7vLaKWer6NiwLW70bJmnm5imoRxhZVvaHCbZmZ%2Bd3%2BVbWufbmNpgXSCxJxvbGw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cassandra-clare-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cassandra Clare Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bone-thugs-n-harmony-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bone Thugs N Harmony Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
