His family, both extended and nuclear, has a history of football players, some playing the game professionally while others quit in college.</span></p><p><span>His grandfather Clay Mathew Snr.&nbsp;played as a tackle for four seasons with the San Francisco 49ners of the National Football League in 1950. Clay Mathews Snr.&nbsp;A veteran soccer player, he was once a pro bowler of the year during his tenure, but had put his career on hold by the start of the Korean War, enlisted in the army and became a paratrooper.&nbsp;His father, Matty Mathews, served as a coach for boxers and baseball at The Citadel in Charleston, Southern California.</span></p><p><span>For Clay Matthews III attended Agoura High School, where he was an active member of the football team.&nbsp;He played under his father, who was the team’s defensive coordinator.&nbsp;His father had trouble training him due to his height.</span></p><span>He later decided to go to college at the University of Southern California and, as expected, joined the school team, but was not active in his freshman and sophomore years.&nbsp;However, the later years he played with the team were rated as outstanding.</span><p><span>He received an athletic scholarship in 2006 and by graduating from school in 2009, he was ranked as one of the top prospects in the NFL draft that year and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers as the 26th overall draft picker in the first round of the draft.</span></p><p><span>A brief overview of Clay’s career after signing with the Packers has revealed that he recorded an impressive tally of tackles, solos, sacks and fumbles.&nbsp;He still plays for the Packers and has never backed down on his magical performances on the team.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family: wife and children</span></strong></h2><p><span>For all the woman Mathew wannabes are out there and it’s sad that Casey Noble has filled the position.&nbsp;Clay Matthews III.&nbsp;Exchanged vows with beautiful interior designer and TV personality in July 2015.&nbsp;Details of how and where they met are nowhere to be found in the records, but they were first portrayed together at the March 2013 National Hockey League Game, using all types of PDAs.&nbsp;From what little we’ve collected, we found out that the two have been in a relationship for a long time, but decided to keep their affairs under the radar.</span></p><p><span>Together, Clay and Casey welcomed their first bundle of joy with William Clay IV in February 2015, and their daughter Madeline Joy joined them in November 2016.</span></p><h2><strong><span>sister and brother</span></strong></h2><p><span>Clay Matthews III is one of five siblings, three brothers and one sister.&nbsp;They are Casey, Brain, Kyle and Jennifer Mathews.&nbsp;All five grew up in Los Angeles, California, where the clay was born.&nbsp;His brother Casey Mathew is also known as one of the best linebackers to play for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League.&nbsp;His sister Jennifer does not play soccer but has taken an interest in the game.&nbsp;Records state that she worked as a model for the National Football League.&nbsp;Mathew’s cousins ​​Kevin Mathew, Jake Mathew and Mike Mathew are all active soccer players.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Clay Matthews III was nearly fired as a footballer during his school days by his father due to his height.&nbsp;This was enough to have a kid wriggle his career under his sleeve, but for him it was one of the stepping stones on which he built his career.&nbsp;If you compare his height to other footballers you can tell that he is of average height, standing at 6ft 3 1⁄8 inches and weighing 110kg.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Having played for the Packers for many years, we could call Clay Matthews an NFL oldie.&nbsp;He is considered one of the best pass rushers and linebackers on his team.</span></p><p><span>From what we’ve seen, the footballer is worth an estimated $35 million on the field.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
