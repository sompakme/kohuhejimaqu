Church <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>President Russell M. Nelson</u></a> and his wife, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Sister Wendy Nelson</u></a>, accordingly <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>visited</u></a> fire victims in January 2019. After seeing the area’s goodness in the face of trial, President Nelson <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>said</u></a>, “Now I feel better informed about what was behind the revelation that there should be a temple in Yuba City.”</p><p><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Kathie Turner</u></a>, who lost her home in the fires, saw the construction of the house of the Lord as “beauty for ashes” (<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Isaiah 61:3</u></a>). She <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>said</u></a>, “The fire affected a broad area, and much of it is now our temple district. ... We all experienced the ashes, and now we are all experiencing the beauty.”</p><p>Local Church leaders held a public open house for the Feather River California Temple from Aug. 19 to Sept. 9, 2023, and invited the community to attend. Several members of other faiths toured the temple during this time.</p><p>Pang Werlhof, a local Latter-day Saint, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>said</u></a>, “This area is filled with such wonderful people, different cultures and religions, and they came together as a community to recognize the importance of our temple and our religion.”</p><p>Holly Brown, who served as a temple open house and dedication coordinator, also saw the support of non-Latter-day Saint residents. “To see their eyes open up and realize that we are really Christians and this temple is all about Jesus Christ, it has been wonderful to share that with people,” <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>she said</u></a>. “It is not a mystery anymore to them.”</p><p>Visitors at the open house included Karm Bains of the Sikh faith, who toured the temple 11 times. “It was just an all-around amazing experience for everybody who attended. The Feather River temple is a real gem in the community,” <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Bains said</u></a>. “To have the house of the Lord right here in Yuba City, Sutter County, is a true blessing, and not just for the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but for the entire community.”</p><p>The Feather River California Temple was <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>dedicated</u></a> in two sessions by<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0> <u>Elder Ulisses Soares</u></a> of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on Oct. 8, 2023. He was joined by <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Elder Kevin R. Duncan</u></a>, General Authority Seventy and executive director of the Temple Department; <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Elder Mark A. Bragg</u></a>, a General Authority Seventy and president of the Church’s North America West Area; and <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Elder James R. Rasband</u></a>, a General Authority Seventy. Their wives were also in attendance.</p><p>“The dedication of this and all the other temples testifies that God has a divine vision and plan for His sons and daughters from all generations,” <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>said</u></a> Elder Soares at the ceremony. “It is indeed evidence of the divinity of His true gospel. This temple stands as a beacon in this area.”</p><p><b>Dedicatory prayer excerpt:</b> “We pray for the members of the Church in this area and their future generations that they can rejoice in Thy covenant path and partake of the blessings of their attendance in this temple, as they come for their own ordinances and covenants or for a vicarious work for their ancestors. May these Saints transform this holy house into their place of defense and refuge from the spiritual storms of the world.”</p><p><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><b>Read the dedicatory prayer of the Feather River California Temple here.</b></a></p><h2 class=chronology_title>Timeline of the Feather River California Temple</h2><p>October</p><p>07</p><p>2018</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b03c41/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1784x1056+108+0/resize/125x74!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-deseret.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F15%2Ff5%2F588034124176be97f5ae14b5d859%2Fpresident-nelson.jpeg"><p>July</p><p>18</p><p>2020</p><p>Groundbreaking</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1fe9309/2147483647/strip/true/crop/912x540+24+0/resize/125x74!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-deseret.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2F22%2F3ead2fd64eb6a29664b24f297b7d%2Ffeather-river-california-temple-groundbreaking.jpeg"><p>August</p><p>19</p><p>2023</p><p>Open house</p><p>A public open house for the Feather River California Temple was held from Aug. 19 to Sept. 9, 2023.

Nelson</u></a>. The Yuba City California Stake Center building, originally on the temple site, was demolished to create room for the temple. The groundbreaking and site dedication were held on July 18, 2020, and presided over by <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Elder Paul H. Watkins</u></a>, Area Seventy.</p><p>After a public open house from Aug. 19 to Sept. 9, 2023, the Feather River California Temple was dedicated on Oct. 8, 2023, by <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>Elder Ulisses Soares</u></a> of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.</p><h2>Architecture and Design of the Feather River California Temple</h2><p>The Feather River temple has an area of 41,665 square feet. This structure features a neo-Byzantine exterior style, which is found in other buildings throughout the Sacramento Valley area. On the roof and toward the front of the temple is a rectangular-shaped tower with an octagonal lantern tower and domed cupola above it.</p><p><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Interior elements</a> of the house of the Lord reflect early Christian architecture, such as a modified quatrefoil pattern in the millwork. Carved carpet patterns represent plants in the area, such as local wildflowers and the California poppy, the state flower. Doors inside the building were made with cherry wood. The motif of the almond blossom — a significant flower in the region — is prominent throughout art-glass windows of the temple.</p><p>The temple site, located across the street from City Hall, spans 9.24 acres and includes a new meetinghouse and distribution center built near the temple. Thousands of plants adorn the site, including mature native oak, redwood and hackberry trees, as well as 100-year-old olive trees from a local orchard.</p><h2>Interior Photos of the Feather River California Temple</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.thechurchnews.com/bs/images/icon-expand.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/e0/19/8e4382014a68b58aee2716e0032f/a0134b45094011eea991eeeeac1e51e940633638.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnJ%2BuqpOdu6bD0meaqKVflrmurc2ammislaK9rbHSaJ2emaSdsrN50aKtnqpdmK6ttcWoqaehkQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-lcsw-supervision-cost-in-california.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Does Lcsw Supervision Cost In California</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./can-i-use-a-heavy-duty-extension-cord-with-space-heater.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Can I use a heavy duty extension cord with space heater?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
