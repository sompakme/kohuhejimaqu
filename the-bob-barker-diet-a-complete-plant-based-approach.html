Being a completely plant-based and nutritious diet, it has kept him away from regular illnesses and chronic diseases and that being the reason he never hesitated to suggest it to other people. Of all the other things he cared for animals and chose to be a vegetarian for them to live their lives.</p><p>Renowned American television personality Bob Barker, born on December 12, 1923, passed away on August 26, 2023. Barker was celebrated for his 35-year tenure as the host of the iconic game show The Price Is Right, making him a cherished presence in homes across America. His illustrious career also encompassed hosting Truth or Consequences and various radio programs.</p><p>Notably, Barker was an impassioned advocate for animal rights, using his platform to promote responsible pet ownership through spaying and neutering. His contributions to television and animal welfare garnered numerous awards, leaving an indelible mark on both industries.</p><h2>The Bob Barker diet: How did the plant-based diet change his life</h2><figure class=image>Bob Barker diet (Image via Getty Images)</figure><p>Bob Barker's adoption of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>plant-based diet</a> marked a significant turning point in his life.

In a 2012 interview with The Vegetarian Times, Barker revealed that he had been a dedicated vegetarian for approximately 35 years.</p><p>He credited his wife with helping him make this transition. Among his preferred dishes was pasta primavera, and he favored vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and asparagus.</p><p>This shift in diet not only aligned with his ethical stance on animal welfare but also yielded substantial improvements in his overall health. Barker reported feeling notably healthier, both physically and mentally, as a result of his plant-based lifestyle. This newfound vitality allowed him to continue hosting The Price Is Right until the impressive age of 83.</p><figure class=image>Bob Barker diet (Image via Getty Images)</figure><p>Furthermore, Barker's commitment to maintaining physical fitness extended beyond his dietary choices. He delved into karate lessons, even training alongside martial arts legend Chuck Norris.
