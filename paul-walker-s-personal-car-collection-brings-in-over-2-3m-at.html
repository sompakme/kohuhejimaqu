The actor co-owned the now-shuttered race car shop Always Evolving in Valencia, California, and inspired a new generation of gearheads before his untimely <a href=#>death</a> at the age of 40 in a car accident in 2013.</p><p>From Wednesday through Saturday of this week, <a href=# rel=nofollow>the actor’s personal collection </a>of 21 cars, trucks and motorcycles hit the auction block as part of a Barrett-Jackson sale in Scottsdale, Arizona. And the final sales added up to $2,333,450, according to Craig Jackson, chairman and CEO of Barrett-Jackson.</p><p>“Paul Walker has been compared to a modern-day Steve McQueen, who lived his passion for racing in every aspect of his life,” Jackson tells The Hollywood Reporter. “[He] has inspired entire generations of car lovers. We worked closely with a close friend of Paul’s who helped care for Paul’s collection following his death; he was responsible for consigning and prepping the vehicles for the auction. Paul’s daughter, Meadow, kept a few vehicles she had a connection with.”</p><img decoding=async width=928 height=522 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/paul_walker_car_auction_-_publicity_-_embed_2-_2020_.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The big draw came on Saturday, when a series of five white BMW M3 Lightweight Editions hit the block, a rarity as they were produced in a limited quantity of 126. The 1995 E36, with just 4,600 miles, brought in the highest dollar amount of the lot: $385,000. The other four drew prices from $220,000 to $258,500.</p><p>“Even without Walker’s name on them, these are incredibly valuable cars that serious collectors would bid on,” says Tom Stahler, managing editor of ClassicCars.com Journal. “They’re basically factory-built race cars. Why Walker had five of them? Perhaps he was planning on putting together a racing team.”</p><p>“Paul was a racer at heart,” says Jackson, who added as a star-power price comparison that Barrett-Jackson auctioned a BMW M3 Lightweight in 2018 for $121,000. “We’re told Paul spent countless hours on the track perfecting his racing skills. The question of whether he intended to build a racing team is something we may never know. When Paul purchased the five BMW M3 Lightweights, he envisioned them as his own investment vehicle.”</p><p>Also on Saturday, a 1991 BMW M3 E30 (with 7,644 miles) went for $220,000, while a 1988 version of the car (with 32,269 miles) got $165,000. Only 5,115 M3s were sold in the U.S. between 1988 and 1991, according to auction notes, and even those with high mileage have gone for upward of $60,000, relates Stahler.</p><p>While Walker never drove the zero-mileage 2013 Ford Mustang Boss 302S, gifted to him by a fellow car enthusiast before being placed into storage, according to auction notes, the car still brought in $95,700.</p><p>Prior to Saturday, the car that brought in the highest dollar amount, on Thursday, was a 2009 Nissan 370Z used as an “extra” in Fast Five that Walker did not drive in the film, with 3,092 miles on the odometer — it sold for $105,600. Also on Thursday, a 1989 Nissan Skyline R32 (with a stripped interior, racing seat, full roll cage and fire extinguisher) went for $100,100, and a custom 1967 Chevy Nova with an engine upgrade went for $60,500.</p><img decoding=async width=928 height=522 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/paul_walker_car_auction_-_publicity_-_embed_1-_2020_.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Stahler translated the value of Walker’s star power. “A 370Z would probably get an average of $30,000 to $50,000 tops,” he tells <i>THR</i>. “And there was a lot of patina and a lot of scratches on the R32, where they pulled the rear wing off; that was a very basic car that would have brought in $30,000 tops and it got [$100,100]. In comparison, there was another really nice R32 Skyline [not owned by Walker] that went across the block an hour before and got $40,000. To be honest, if I was going to get a car to drive, I would have bought the one that sold for $40,000.”</p><p>Continues Stahler: “Paul Walker is completely identified with the tuner-drifter part of car culture; Gen Xers and Millennials identified with him. It’s such a shame that he was killed, because he would have been this generation’s Jay Leno; unfortunately, he became this generation’s James Dean.”</p><p>All proceeds from the auction will go to a trust for Walker’s 21-year-old daughter, Meadow Rain Walker, who manages the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Paul Walker Foundation</a>, dedicated to providing grants and scholarships that benefit marine science.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLGt1KVksJmcoLKzedJmp56qo6S7oriMnJirZZOkua2xwq2gqKZdl7%2BqusasZGtrnWKutXnArpqtoZ%2BjenJ%2Blmlwam9f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rae-dawn-chong-net-worth-2024-what-is-the-actress-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rae Dawn Chong Net Worth 2024: What Is The Actress Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nelly-ashanti-relationship-timeline.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nelly &amp;amp; Ashanti: Relationship Timeline</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
