Was it to see if he was asleep, or was it to make sure he wouldn't see the kiss? We might never know. Despite Kie checking on JJ, he does see the kiss.<h2>Do Kie and JJ date in season 3?</h2>While that never happened, it now looks like Outer Banks season 3 will finally be giving the JJ/Kie shippers everything they've ever wanted.
