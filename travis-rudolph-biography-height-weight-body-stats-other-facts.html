widely known not only for the game, but for making national headlines.&nbsp;He’s the wide receiver for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL), who also played college football and was so great that Rivals.com rated him a five-star rookie and they weren’t wrong. .</span></p><p><span>Besides sports, Travis Rudolph is known as the kind hero who popularized an autistic boy among his peers.&nbsp;The Wide Receiver made national headlines in August 2016 when he visited Montford Middle School in Tallahassee.&nbsp;He chose to sit and have lunch with Bo Paske, an autistic student, left alone in the school cafeteria.</span></p><h2><strong><span>The biography of Travis Rudolph</span></strong></h2><p><span class=w8qArf><span>Travis Rudolph was born on September 15, 1995 in West Palm Beach, Florida, United States to parents&nbsp;</span></span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>Darryl Rudolph and Linda Rudolph.&nbsp;He also has an older sister.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>Raised in the Florida city alongside his older sister, Rudolph graduated from Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm Beach, where he played football as a senior.</span></span></p><p><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>He was one of the best and ranked number 1 in his class;&nbsp;with 63 receptions for school records 1,237 yards and 15 touchdowns.&nbsp;</span></span><span>After graduating from high school, Rudolph committed to playing college football at Florida State University.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Rudolph started playing as a freshman at Florida State University in 2014. He played in 13 games with 13 starts and 38 receptions for 555 yards and four touchdowns.&nbsp;In his sophomore season, he played in 13 games with 11 starts and led his team to 59 receptions, 916 receiving yards and 7 touchdown receptions.</span></p><p><span>In the 2015 Peach Bowl, Rudolph hit a career high with 7 catches and 201 receptions for 201 yards.&nbsp;He broke the original record of 195 receiving yards held by Javon Walker in the 2002 Gator Bowl.</span></p><p><span>The following year as a junior, he played 13 games, making 7 touchdowns with 840 receiving yards.&nbsp;At the end of the season, Rudolph decided to spend the senior year at Florida State and enter the 2017 NFL Draft.</span></p><p><span>As a result of the draft, Travis Rudolph signed with the New York Giants as a free agent, but they were waived on September 2, 2017, and drafted into the practice squad the following day.&nbsp;With the Giants, he captured the imagination of fans with an excellent pre-season;&nbsp;catching 9 passes for 157 yards.&nbsp;He got his chance to be promoted to the active roster on October 9, when injuries caused him to be redirected several recipients from the team.</span></p><p><span>He had his first NFL action in Week 7, playing against the Seattle Seahawks on October 22 and finishing with 3 receptions for 32 yards.&nbsp;The 2018 season got off to a rather competitive start as Rudolph competed against some of the team’s best players for reserved spots.&nbsp;His pre-season success in 2017 was a bonus and now he should continue to work on racing, reliability and special teams.</span></p><h2><strong><span>other facts</span></strong></h2><p><span>Travis Rudolph was a three-time All-Florida pick and won the Lou Groza Awards High School Player of the Year as a senior.</span></p><p><span>Cousin of former NFL wide receiver and return specialist Devin Hester.</span></p><p><span>As a freshman in 2014, he was ranked Florida’s No. 1 wide receiver prospect and No. 11 overall;&nbsp;Five-star rookie by Rivals and 247Sports;&nbsp;and four-star perspective by ESPN.</span></p><p><span>He was nominated for the 2014 Hall of Fame in Palm Beach.</span></p><p><span>Rudolph’s benevolent gesture towards a young boy with autism named Bo Paske makes him a national hero.&nbsp;He didn’t stop there, he invited Bo and his mother to play in Orlando and gave him a personalized Seminoles jersey.</span></p><p><span>On March 28, 2017, Rudolph took to his Instagram page to announce that he had joined the multinational Adidas athlete promoter channel.</span></p><p><span>Just a month later, tragedy struck when Rudolph’s father was hit by a stray bullet while working at a strip club in West Palm Beach.&nbsp;Darryl was reportedly in storage and was hit by a bullet from a gun that exploded in the adjacent room when a colleague pulled her from the shelf.&nbsp;The bullet had pierced the wall and hit him in the neck.&nbsp;It happened in April 2017, days before the 2017 NFL Draft.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body Stats</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>Height:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;6’0”</span><br><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;189lbs Arm</span><br><strong><span>Length:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;317/8</span><br><strong><span>Hands:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;9 1/4″</span></p><p><strong><span>Strength:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;NFL analysis rates him as a solid line-up runner with good tempo, consistency and smooth acceleration.&nbsp;His body and balance are apparently on point.&nbsp;He has good ball skills and effectively disguises return lanes against man coverage.</span></p><p><strong><span>Weakness:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;According to the NFL, Rudolph needs to improve his playing strength to help with next-level contested catches;&nbsp;moreover, its stop-start acceleration is nothing special.&nbsp;However, his consistent speed and careful work on the routes are credited as he is expected to get stronger.</span></p><p class=postsid
