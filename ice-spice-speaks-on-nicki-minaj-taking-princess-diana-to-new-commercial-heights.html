Regardless, the Bronx MC has a lot to look forward to this year, such as her next album and more promo, media, and partnership opportunities than ever. But she took some time during a recent Billboard interview to shout out some unexpected and underrated bangers of hers. The 24-year-old remarked that "Princess Diana" was her favorite hit of 2023, but that she was disappointed that it didn't chart -– until Roman stepped in.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">’Princess Diana’ with Nicki</a> [was my favorite hit of the year]," Ice Spice remarked to the publication. "Because I felt like ‘Princess Diana’ was already my best song on [Like…?]. But then it didn’t chart or anything until Nicki got on it. I was just so happy to have both of those worlds where I felt like it was culturally a great song, but also it charted. And then I had my dream collab fulfilled at the same time."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ice-spice-at-the-2024-people-s-choice-awards>Ice Spice At The 2024 People's Choice Awards</h2></span><p>SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 18: Ice Spice attends the 2024 People's Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on February 18, 2024 in Santa Monica, California.

You might think that such a question would only focus on the positive ones, but she feels like she deserves a bit more love for one particular song. "I thought that ‘Actin a Smoochie’ would be a bigger song,” the 2024 Grammy nominee conceded. “Every time I hear it, I’m just gagged that it’s not bigger. [But] ‘<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Boy’s a liar, Pt. 2</a>,’ I never thought that song would be as big as it is. I knew it would be a big moment, but I didn’t think it would be triple-platinum.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, she also spoke on the creative process behind <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her next album Y2K</a> and what drives her to write and record a track. "If the beat doesn’t instantly move me, like. if I don’t physically feel the beat of the speakers, then I’m just going to keep moving on to the next one,” the "Think U The S**t (Fart)" spitter revealed. “But as soon as I know, I know I have that beat. It’s up from there."
