Thousands of fans gathered at the legendary park that Mac Miller named his debut album after to honor his legacy. The vigil&nbsp;was organized by Nightfall Records. Around 7 p.m. they estimated that roughly 22K people gather at the park already to pay tribute to the late rapper. Mac Miller's grandmother spoke at the vigil and gave an emotional speech about Mac Miller.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The cause of his death is still unknown at this point. Now, the L.A. County Coroner is waiting for the toxicology results to come in before announcing an official ruling which could take a few more weeks.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Mac Miller was found dead at his San Fernando Valley home on Friday from an apparent overdose. Police searched his home for clues after his death but only found a small amount of white powder. With the exception of the small white powder, police said they found no other evidence of drug use in his home.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
