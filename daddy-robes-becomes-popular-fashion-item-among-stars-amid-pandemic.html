The robes, weighing up to 11 pounds, are made in fleece, velvet and mink, and cost from $555 to $1,111, with custom looks going higher. The label’s clientele includes YouTuber Logan Paul, singer <a href=# id=auto-tag_trey-songz data-tag=trey-songz>Trey Songz</a> and actor Shemar Moore, who <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">posted his look to his Instagram</a>. Rapper Trippie Redd notably paid $11,111.11 for a custom robe in November.</p><p>“I’m the most comfortable man in the world. I’ve worn a robe every day for over the past decade,” says Justice, who’s known for the style choice as well as for cooking with Hennessy cognac in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">YouTube videos under the name Chef Henny</a>. “People are spending so much time in their homes, so I wanted to utilize that knowledge and produce something that would make the world more comfortable.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><img decoding=async width=1024 height=1203 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/credit-Shemar-Moore-EMBED-2021-1611872248.jpg alt="Actor Shemar Moore in one of the brand’s styles, which include floral, dragon and peacock designs." sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Daddy Robes was still in the prototype phase at the start of the pandemic because production was proving to be an issue. “It was a bit of a dead project because I kept getting scammed by different companies that were doing production,” says Justice. “Then I finally found someone legit.”</p><p>Justice met Dark Denim, his clothing maker, shortly after driving to Los Angeles last year to work on his latest album, and the brand took off from there. “Right now, it’s a very small team, five altogether,” says Justice. “Three of us are tailors and they kind of collaborate, and I do more of the design and creative for the brand.”</p><p>When first starting out, Justice focused on designs that reflected his own style. “It was about what I like,” he says. “I have different personalities. I feel different ways on different days. Then I kind of spun off that in the styling and various colorways. My goal was to create a robe that anyone could wear.” Current looks include various floral combinations, a peacock robe, a dragon robe and multiple celestial-inspired styles. In 2021, Justice plans to release more occupation-focused robes, such as a fireman-inspired robe and a robe that looks like a suit.</p><p>The new year brings more than just new styles of Daddy Robes: The brand announced in December that they would soon offer a line of children’s robes as well, after a number of clients ordered custom matching robes for their children. Justice is currently working on one for Songz’s son.</p><p>In terms of other fashion ventures, Justice has an exciting announcement coming soon: “People can definitely expect my debut into the shoe game very soon with a very, very big manufacturer.”</p><p>A version of this story first appeared in the Jan. 27 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. <a href=# rel=noopener>Click here to subscribe.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvSrbClnV%2BZrqWw2GapqJqVqHqjscKopJ6rXaW8scHLmqlmnpGotaq7zWagrZ2dYq6uu82gZKyskafAbq3MoptmqJGjsaa5yJxkbWliZ356hY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-do-you-remove-kitchenaid-freezer-drawers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How do you remove Kitchenaid freezer drawers?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./arsenal-have-agreed-to-sign-phenomenal-defender-for-nothing-next-summer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Arsenal have agreed to sign phenomenal defender for nothing next summer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
