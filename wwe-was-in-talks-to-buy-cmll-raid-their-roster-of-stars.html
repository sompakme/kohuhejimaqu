They also desperately want to acquire talent from Latin America to boost that fan base. This entailed opening a WWE Performance Center in the region for a time, <a href=#>but those plans were put on ice </a>due to the pandemic. Then WWE’s entire <a href=#>focus for NXT changed</a>. That didn’t stop them from considering a big purchase.</p><p>According to a note in the <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, WWE tried purchasing CMLL during a time. This was years ago, but the thought was that they could groom the company’s top wrestlers to be potential crossover stars for WWE’s main roster.</p><p>While not known about, there were talks a few years back of WWE buying CMLL. WWE wanted to run Mexico with the idea it could get the cream of the cream talent in Mexico and then groom some of them for the U.S. market. The belief was that if they owned CMLL and got all the top talent, that AAA wouldn’t be able to keep its talent and they’d have the best of both. Where the deal fell apart was for CMLL to sell, they wanted selling the arenas as part of the deal and WWE didn’t want to own so many older arenas</p><p>WWE is focusing on themselves right now and not purchasing other companies. You can never write off the possibility that Vince McMahon’s company will be in a buyer’s mood once again, but it seems that they are more focused on cost cutting measures right now.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
