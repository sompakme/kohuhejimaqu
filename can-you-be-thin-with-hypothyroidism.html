In contrast, if the thyroid produces more hormones than the body needs, you may lose weight unexpectedly.</p><h2>Does hypothyroidism make you skinny or fat?</h2>Since the BMR in a person with hypothyroidism is decreased, an underactive thyroid is generally associated with some weight gain. The weight gain is often greater in those individuals with more severe hypothyroidism.<h2>Can you be fit with hypothyroidism?</h2>Hypothyroidism can trigger muscle and joint pain and can leave you feeling fatigued and depressed.
