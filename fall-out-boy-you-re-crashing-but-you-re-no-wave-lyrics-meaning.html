However, it can very easily be interpreted as being about To Kill a Mockingbird, especially the trial of Tom Robinson, to the point where I suspect that this is actually what the song is about. Let’s dissect this song, line by line.)</p><p>"You're Crashing, But You're No Wave", by Fall Out Boy</p><p>The D.A. is dressed to the nines<br>In the mirror he practices all his lines</p><p>This stanza is by far about Atticus Finch. He is the DA, defense attorney, ‘dressed to the nines’ because Scout always maintains, throughout the novel, that he is a well-dressed man, to the point where, when he is not so, it’s as if he is ‘stark naked’, according to Scout. ‘In the mirror he practices all his lines’ is about his eloquence, along with his brilliant defense of Tom Robinson and how well he must have practiced it before the trial, probably also reference to how little Mr. Gilmer practiced his--and yet he won.</p><p>To his closing argument twelve hearts beat in favor</p><p>Now, this line could be interpreted one of two ways. One: the jury, made up of whites, twelve whites, agrees with Atticus’ defense (especially his extremely strong closing argument), but finds him guilty anyway (as in the book), symbolizing how the racial prejudice overcomes their logic. Less likely, it could also be about the twelve people that truly are on Atticus’ side: Scout, Jem, Calpurnia, Zeebo, Dill, Mrs. Robinson, Link Deas, Mr. Cunningham, Heck Tate, Dolphus Raymond, Miss Maudie, and Reverend Sykes.</p><p>I'm guessing that he read the morning paper<br>The headline reads "the man hangs", but the jury doesn't--</p><p>Atticus was an avid reader of the paper, as evidence many times in the book. It is telling him that no matter what, the headline will read ‘the man hangs’, or man guilty, whatever, even if the jury doesn’t think he’s truly guilty, as in the book. So not only is it a nod to his character, but to one of the biggest issues in the book as well.</p><p>And everyone's looking for relief<br>United States versus disbelief</p><p>The people of the trial, and, more broadly, of the south, are ‘looking for relief’ because they are so afraid of the rapidly approaching truth that black people are equal. It’s them versus their ‘disbelief’ that whites and blacks can be equal. The ‘versus’ is also probably a nod to not only TR’s trial, but all of the people that went on trial and lost unjustly because of their race.</p><p>Mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle</p><p>This is probably a reference to how the mothers on both sides--the blacks and the whites--are tearing up for Tom Robinson. Also, Scout references many times the babies ‘shushing up’, so this could be about that, too (casting their tears away).</p><p>Clear your throat and face the world</p><p>This may be about how when Mr. Gilmer cross-examines Tom and he’s ‘clearing his throat and facing the world’, namely, the whites. Mr. Gilmer makes him trip over his words and is mean to him, unlike Atticus was.</p><p>The verdict falls like bachelors for bad luck girls<br>Only breathing with the aid of denial.</p><p>The only people the verdict shocks are Jem and Scout. This partway references the end of this part of the story (the jury is out for a while but finds him guilty). The second line is obvious, the only reason the jury finds him guilty is because of ‘the aid of denial’, denial of both Atticus’ flawless defense and Tom’s innocence, because of their racism.</p><p>Case open, case shut,<br>But you could pay to close it like a casket</p><p>The minute the case is open, this case is shut, because it’s a black versus a white. You could practically pay to close it, you wouldn’t even have to, because it’s already decided. ‘Like a casket’ is a clever nod to Tom’s impending sentence, and his death because of said sentence.</p><p>Baby boy can't lift his headache head<br>Isn't it tragic? (Whoaaa-ooo)</p><p>This is a little off topic--Mr. Raymond’s children can’t lift their heads because they’re ‘mixed’, and not only discrimination against them, but all African-Americans, is the real tragedy here. It’s kind of a cynical thing to say to the white people.</p><p>He glances at his peers sitting seven to twelve stacked<br>On one to six the gallery is hushed</p><p>Now, these are some unclear terms here. I am not a legal expert. I assume this is just a nod to how they believe Tom is innocent but condemn him. Honestly, I don’t quite know.</p><p>Boys in three pieces dream of grandstanding and bravado</p><p>This probably references Atticus, and his dreams of how there’s the tiniest chance he might win the case, and how if he did, he’d be a legend among attorneys. However, since it says ‘boys’, it might also be about Jem/how much Jem looks up to Atticus, and later, the destruction of his faith in the American Justice System.</p><p>The city sleeps in a cell notwithstanding what we all know</p><p>‘The city’ is probably just a pseudonym for Tom, and maybe how he represents the underrepresented African-Americans in Maycomb County. He sleeps in a cell before the appeal he never gets, even though we all know he’s innocent, and Mayella/Bob Ewell are the real criminals here.</p><p>Hang on a rope or bated breath<br>Whichever you prefer</p><p>This is a grim nod to how Tom, Jem, Scout, Atticus, etc. all wait with bated breath for the jury’s decision, but know Tom will end up ‘on a rope’, essentially. ‘Whichever you prefer’ is an ironic line, since he doesn’t have a choice.</p><p>And everyone's looking for relief</p><p>(see first occurrence of this line)</p><p>A bidding war for an old flame's grief</p><p>This line is probably about Mayella and Tom, it could be about how they’re trying to cause her ‘old flame’, or Tom’s, grief. The ‘bidding war’ could also be a reference to how they’re both trying to pin the guilt on one another. (Even though, let’s be honest here, Atticus totally schooled Mayella in the courtroom.)</p><p>The cause, the kid, the course, the charm, and the curse</p><p>The cause: racism; the kid: Scout; the course: the course of the trial (?); the charm: Atticus’ charisma/the whites’ ‘charm’ (they can’t lose a case); the curse: African-Americans are doomed to lose their cases despite huge evidence to the contrary.</p><p>Not a word that could make you comprehend</p><p>Not a word of Atticus’ hugely convincing defense could make them comprehend the truth they don’t want to hear: Tom Robinson is innocent.</p><p>Too well dressed for the witness stand</p><p>This is probably an ironic nod to how both Tom and Mayella were badly dressed, or poor. No one well-dressed went to the witness stand.</p><p>The press prays for whichever headline's worse</p><p>The press, the white press, wants Tom to lose his case. They’re praying for it, so as not to upset the racial status quo.</p><p>Case open, case shut,<br>But you could pay to close it like a casket<br>Baby boy can't lift his headache head<br>Isn't it tragic? (Whoaaa-ooo)<br>(see first occurrence of these lines)</p><p>Fresh pressed suit and tie</p><p>Atticus dresses perfectly. He also removes his tie, among other bits of clothing, during his closing argument.</p><p>Unimpressed birds sing and die</p><p>This is the most obvious nod to the book in the song. Tom, the mockingbird of our story, the one who never did anything but sing, a sin to kill, eventually dies in his prison escape attempt. He was unimpressed with Mayella’s advances, and it’s what kills him. He sang, nothing more, and he yet died for it. “Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember, it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”-Atticus Finch</p><p>Can talk my way out of anything</p><p>Atticus is an extraordinary lawyer, and can talk his way out of anything, it seems. Yet, what happens in the next line breaks that perfect record.</p><p>The foreman reads the verdict<br>"In the above entitled actions we find the defendant..."<br>Guilty...Guilty...Guilty...Guilty…</p><p>Tom was found guilty, and died before his appeal. This is essentially the end of the song.</p><p>Case open, case shut,<br>But you could pay to close it like a casket<br>Baby boy can't lift his headache head<br>Isn't it tragic?<br>[x2]</p><p>(see above dissection of these lines)</p><p>(Whoaaa-ooo)</p><p>Patrick Stump making noise.</p><p>And that’s it. My way with words is not that of Atticus’, but I do think that this song is really about To Kill a Mockingbird. However, Pete Wentz is as articulate as Atticus Finch or Harper Lee, so it could be about whatever he wants, really.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZp%2BZnKF6sMHTZpmosV%2BuvLa%2BxGaaq5mjnbavs4ybrK1lqaTCs7GMp6Zmr5Grsg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-marty-stuart-make-latest-marty-stuart-net-worth-income-salary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Marty Stuart Make?
