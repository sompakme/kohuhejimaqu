A Florida police department post resurfaced, featuring an image of Lil Boom, asking for help identifying him. They accused him of "touching the backside of multiple people including children" at a Walmart. They later identified him by both his government name and his moniker.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">No Jumper went on to share the resurfaced post on Instagram, resulting in outrage among fans and peers. It also prompted a response from Lil Boom, who claims that the allegations are false. According to him, people are simply trying "cap on" him to make him look bad. "I fell off already bub u shoulda tried to cap on me in like 2018," he wrote. "This is so cap n***a if this was true i'd be on a f*cking registry." <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">1090 Jake</a> later left an ominous reply to his comment, asking if he was "sure bout that."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sexyy-red-says-lil-boom-accusations-are-sick><a href=# class=text-word>Sexyy Red</a> Says Lil Boom Accusations Are "Sick"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Regardless, fans and critics alike continue to have their doubts.

She's not alone, as countless other users share their disgust amid the allegations. One person who's on Lil Boom's side is his girlfriend, who claims that another shopper in the store made the accusations falsely after a less-than-pleasant encounter.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Racist white lady got mad at him cause he shoved himself thru to get by, then she lied on his name on sexual assault," she alleges.
