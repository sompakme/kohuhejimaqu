We asked six women to give us their definition of the word “love.”</p><p>What a loaded question! I can’t help but instantly think of the 1st Corinthians Bible verse. It just gives such an amazingly perfect definition of love (1 Corinthians 13:4-7). When I think of what love means to me personally, though, I think of all the different types of love I have for the people in my life. There’s romantic love, family love, friend love and the most incredible love of all: soul mate love. I knew my fiancé was ‘the one’ when I realized he is the only person in the world that I love romantically, as my family and as my best friend. Our love is easy! Love should never be difficult. Life is difficult enough. <strong>— Jenna W.</strong></p><p>Love is caring for someone else deeply and unconditionally. Love is being motivated to be the best version of yourself that you can possibly be because you are so passionate about the other person. <strong><strong>—</strong> Elise H.</strong></p><p>To me, love means finding someone that brings out the best version of yourself and challenges you to be better. Someone who you are completely comfortable with and who knows you inside and out. Someone who is truly your partner and best friend and that you can share all your experiences with. <strong><strong>—</strong> Nina R.</strong></p><p>Love means knowing that no matter what, you have someone to count on. It’s unconditional and makes you feel good on the inside. You can trust the person you love and are comfortable around them. It’s like your heart tells you that it is good for you. Love never hurts or makes you cry your eyes out. It’s very gentle and warm. You never give up on the people you love. <strong><strong>—</strong> Lisa S.</strong></p><p>To me, true love is when you can completely be yourself around another person in good times and bad. It’s loving each other’s differences and appreciating them exactly as they are. Love is the feeling that something is missing when you are apart and the realization that everything seems so much better when you are together. <strong><strong>—</strong> Vanessa S.</strong></p><p>Love… I believe this word gets tossed around more than it should. It’s more than just a simple word and can have a lot of meanings. Just to name a few: trust, commitment, best friends, communication, willingness, arguments and tenderness. <strong><strong>—</strong> Amanda T.</strong></p><h3>More love and relationship articles</h3><p><a href=#>10 Women reveal the moment they knew it was time to move on<br></a><a href=#>9 Not-so-noticeable signs you’re dating a psychopath<br></a><a href=#>Real women dish on their biggest wedding planning oops!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqGcmqSknXqiusNmrp6knKOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsrR7mHJtcGhpZMSprdNmm6ido2LBqbGMsKarnF2hvLexjKacmqZdqbxuxc6uZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-quavo-and-offset-have-been-doing-since-takeoff-s-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Quavo And Offset Have Been Doing Since Takeoff's Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-cochrane-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Cochrane Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
