She now resides in one place, focusing on influencing historical homes with a touch of <a href=#>modernist</a> idealism. This devoted homebody uses her past studies in psychology and combines them to create happy homes, a space that suits the soul.</p><p>Getting inspiration from local craftsmen and the awe-inspiring landscapes surrounding Salt Lake City, this interior designer is always looking for ways to wow herself and her clients through her designs. Her work will remind you of the traditional “prairie living” interiors that once reflected homes of the old west. It brings a lot of nostalgia throughout its simple lines and colors, but modernism brings balance that doesn’t allow the space to ever feel outdated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Jessica, the owner, and designer of Alice Lane Interiors, with her lovely Salt Lake City interior designers at her back, offers some of the best design services in Utah. So, with a major title like this, you know you’re going to be in for a real treat! While Alice Lane Interiors is a full-service interior design firm, there is a unique quirk. It’s also a store! So, those in the Salt Lake City area, or even those who want to shop the beautiful home collection, can do so online.</p><p>Jessica’s beautiful home collection keeps up with her aesthetics perfectly. This includes the plush fabrics that she utilizes in her designs and textures, from knits to velvets. But it goes beyond that. Pastels, neutrals, and clean (but soft) patterns are also shown off in her collection but still tastefully articulated in designs too. Jessica has definitely made her mark in Salt Lake City and the rest of Utah!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Sam is an interior designer, but something different about her just makes her pop compared to the other Salt Lake City interior designers. While she loves collaborating with clients on the styles and colors of their homes, she likes to go a bit deeper than just that.</p><p>Her main service is about creating organized spaces for clients. This includes helping them clear out the clutter and getting their space to look as clean and organized as those influencers on social media. Needless to say, time and time again, she completely achieves this. Sam’s clients rave over her effectiveness and aesthetics in shaping the space. Thanks to her expertise, her transformations are phenomenal.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Dating back to 1987, this well-established design firm has always impacted Salt Lake City, but now the business has made some transformations. Doran Taylor, the founder, used to be a one-man show, but now, he works with two of the best Salt Lake City interior designers, his sons! This family-owned business is all about creating gorgeous environments that reflect individual personalities.</p><p>This family is inspired by the diversity, the adventures, and the ever-changing trends that the interior industry has to offer. As a result, their designs are very clean and sophisticated, and Doran has a way of making even the bleakest of spaces look completely <a href=#>expensive</a>. But in the end, the overall goal is to make a space that feels inviting and comfortable, a space where the clients live and live, entertain, and completely embrace.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cody, the founder of this lovely Salt Lake City-based interior design firm, always offers a new perspective. He delivers something elegant but still functional to his clients. With this knowledge and passion, Cody always enhances the livability of a space. His designs translate beautifully, too! It’s all about creating better living and well-being, not just creating something aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>His designs are super sleek; even though it’s all about functionality, he is still able to bring beauty too. This includes having a more modern-luxe preference that includes shades of black, metallic, neutrals, and hints of gold within his palette. Clean thin lines and pristine lighting are other elements that commonly appear in his designs, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbHEq6qpmZOae6S7zGipnqufqr%2BksdJooKeslae2sL6MnZysoZejsrO%2FjKyYpaxdoa6ssYycoK2xXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-sheer-dress-trend-is-taking-over-hollywood.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Sheer Dress Trend Is Taking Over Hollywood</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./temptation-star-jurnee-smollett-bell-on-marriage-and-relationships.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Temptation Star Jurnee Smollett-Bell on Marriage and Relationships</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
