Despite launching in the prime post-Super Bowl slot on Fox, where it averaged 17.6 million viewers and a 6.1 rating among adults 18-49 (down 3 percent vs. last year’s telecast on CBS), the 12-episode series wrapped with 6.3 million total viewers and a 1.7 in the demo — with seven days of DVR.</p><p>While 24: Legacy will not be back for a second season, Fox is already talking with 24 producers — including Howard Gordon and Brian Grazer, who are said to be very involved — for a new anthological take on the franchise. Network brass remain confident that 24 will return for a new incarnation that would be built around 24‘s famous real-time storytelling device. It will not, however, be a version of Legacy, meaning stars Hawkins and Jimmy <span data-scayt_word=Smits data-scaytid=1>Smits</span> would not be involved. (Female lead Miranda Otto was killed off in the Legacy finale.) The anthology format makes sense for the franchise and would allow for the creation of new storylines and characters in every incarnation.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>24 remains a valuable franchise for Fox; it originally ran for eight seasons before being revived with original star Kiefer Sutherland for event series 24: Live Another Day. Legacy followed that series, but it was built around Hawkins (Straight <span data-scayt_word=Outta data-scaytid=3>Outta</span> Compton, The Walking Dead) and told a new story. Sutherland did not return but was credited as an executive producer. For his part, Sutherland’s ABC drama Designated Survivor was renewed for a second season and will return in the fall with its fourth <span data-scayt_word=showrunner data-scaytid=4>showrunner</span>.</p><p>Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Gordon flew back to the U.S. in April and early May in an effort to revive 24, with talks said to have included a pitch to save Legacy.</p><p>Speaking with <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=7>THR</span> after the Legacy finale, <span data-scayt_word=showrunner data-scaytid=5>showrunner</span> Manny <span data-scayt_word=Coto data-scaytid=9>Coto</span> acknowledged Fox would have wanted the ratings to be higher and said he was “hopeful” for a second run. “There are ideas [for a second season] that we’ve floated around,” he said. “We all know where we want to take the next season. I could say pretty confidently that it would probably be [the protagonist] Eric [Carter] as a <span data-scayt_word=CTU data-scaytid=10>CTU</span> agent, and my guess is it would be in a place that’s not necessarily the U.S. As a young agent, he’s stuck somewhere. He’s not getting the choicest assignments. It might be fun [to focus on] someone in some backwater <span data-scayt_word=CTU data-scaytid=11>CTU</span> station who ends up stumbling on a larger plot that could bring down the country. My feeling for next season would be something where the country is at stake in a large way. It involves Jimmy <span data-scayt_word=Smits data-scaytid=6>Smits</span> and the country and his presidency. It would hopefully go big, and be more along the lines of&nbsp;Live Another Day,&nbsp;and be larger than life and still explore relationships, like Eric and his wife. Are they still together? Are they not?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOa2tmpJWcrqTFjJyYp5uVobKlecCsZJ%2BnqGKyurHSZpinrJikubCz2Gadq5memLWqv8SsZJ%2BtpKq%2FpnmQaWhqa2hufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./odeya-rush-bio-age-height-measurements-net-worth-boyfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Odeya Rush bio: age, height, measurements, net worth, boyfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-farrior-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Farrior Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
