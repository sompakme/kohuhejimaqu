It's a crime not to help. That's how I see it," he told AFP.</p><p class=align-left>Rhee was born in South Korea but raised in the United States. He attended the Virginia Military Institute and planned to join the US Navy SEALS, but his father -- a "patriot", he says -- convinced his son to return to South Korea to enlist.</p><p class=align-left>He served for seven years, undergoing both US and Korean SEAL training and doing multiple stints in war zones in Somalia and Iraq before leaving to set up a defence consultancy.</p><p class=align-left>"I have the skillset. I have the experience. I was in two different wars, and going to Ukraine, I knew I could help," he said, adding that he viewed breaking South Korea's passport law to leave as equivalent to a "traffic violation".</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d5e583859ea12c19.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Norway pays tribute to victims of Oslo shooting</span></p></a><h2>Backlash in Korea</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a4070762e9ea3ce5.jpg><p class=align-left>But the reaction in South Korea -- where Rhee shot to fame as a trainer in the popular YouTube series "Fake Men" -- was swift and unforgiving.</p><p class=align-left>"It was instant. People in Korea, they just criticised me about breaking the law," said Rhee.</p><p class=align-left>His critics claim the 38-year-old's decision was criminally irresponsible, and point to his posting of war footage on his YouTube and Instagram accounts as evidence of showboating.</p><p class=align-left>Rhee says he tries not to let the furore get to him. "I think it's pretty obvious who the good guys are and who the bad guys are," he said of Russia and Ukraine.</p><p class=align-left>On his first day on the frontline in Irpin -- which he describes as "the Wild West" and "chaos" -- he says he witnessed Russian war crimes.</p><p class=align-left>"I saw a civilian get shot. He was driving... and they shot him through the windshield and he died in front of us," he said.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/40256b78564b7e7f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kagame defends Rwanda on rights as Commonwealth expands</span></p></a><p class=align-left>"It was like: there's my proof. There's definitely war crimes going on. It reminded me and my teammates what we were doing and why we were there," he said.</p><p class=align-left>Because of his military training, Rhee was told to set up his own team, so he recruited other volunteers with combat experience and set up a multi-national special operations group.</p><p class=align-left>"I was eating Canadian MREs. My gun was from the Czech Republic. I have a Javelin missile from the United States. I have a rocket that's from Germany... but nothing is Korean," he said.</p><p class=align-left>He tried to take his Korean-made night vision goggles but was not given government export permission. Seoul has provided non-lethal aid to Kyiv, but Rhee said they could do more.</p><p class=align-left>"Korea has state-of-the-art equipment... they're very good at making weapons," he said.</p><h2>'See you in Taiwan'</h2><p class=align-left>Russia said this week that 13 South Koreans had travelled to Ukraine -- including four who were killed. Seoul said it was trying to verify the claims.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ef71bdc88e693404.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Afghan held in Guantanamo prison freed</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although Rhee did not know the fate of all his teammates, he said "a lot of my friends have died".</p><p class=align-left>"I don't want my friends' sacrifices to be forgotten," he said, adding that he plans to write a book -- and maybe a screenplay -- about his team's experiences.</p><p class=align-left>But first, he needs to deal with the official repercussions of his trip. He is quietly optimistic South Korea's new conservative administration won't put him in jail.</p><p class=align-left>Rhee is not allowed to leave the country until his case is resolved, and is receiving treatment for his injuries. But he hopes one day to fight alongside his teammates again, for a cause they believe in.</p><p class=align-left>The joke as people left the frontline was: "See you in Taiwan," he said, referring darkly to the risk that Beijing will follow Moscow's lead and invade a neighbouring democracy.</p><p>Source: AFP</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkxLC%2By51mamxna4J5f4ycqaKllWLAsMHToWSkp6Karq950p6YpWWloL%2Bitc2eZKudl6eytb%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-honey-remove-blackheads.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can honey remove blackheads?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-the-best-dancer-in-kpop-2023-who-takes-the-crown.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is the Best Dancer in Kpop 2023? | Who Takes the Crown?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
