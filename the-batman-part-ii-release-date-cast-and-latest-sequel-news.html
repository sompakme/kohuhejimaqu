It went on to raking in $134 million domestically, making it the second-largest launch of the pandemic era after <a href=# rel=noopener>Marvel’s Spider-Man: No Way Home’s $260m</a> back in December 2021. It was the largest weekend for Warner Bros in five years and the best ever start for filmmaker Reeves.</p><p>“It’s fun to see the public really embrace the movie,” Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>. “Since the movie is three hours long, it became appointment viewing. That bodes well for its run on the big screen. It helps that the word of mouth is so strong.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2022/03/the-batman-1bacdfd.jpg><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Batman</a> takes place just two years into Bruce Wayne’s journey as Batman as he descends into darkness to track down a new enemy: the Riddler (Paul Dano). Pattinson is joined by <a href=# rel=noopener>a star-studded cast</a> including Colin Farrell as the Penguin, Andy Serkis as Alfred and Jeffrey Wright as Jim Gordon.</p><p>The ending of the movie teases an intriguing future for the characters and for Gotham City, leaving plenty of room for more stories in Robert Pattinson’s Batman universe.</p><p>But which Batman villains will appear in The Batman’s sequel? Read on for everything we know about The Batman 2. Be warned: <strong>spoilers for The Batman follow.</strong></p><h2 id=will-there-be-a-sequel-to-the-batman-1e36254b><strong>Will there be a sequel to The Batman?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2022/02/TheBatmanRiddlerLair-35f0816.jpeg><p>Yes! Warner Bros has officially announced there would be a Batman sequel at CinemaCon 2022.</p><p>“Matt took one of our most iconic and beloved superheroes and delivered a fresh vision,” Warner Bros. movie chief Toby Emmerich said during the panel. “Matt Reeves, Rob Pattinson and the entire team will be taking audiences back to Gotham with The Batman 2.”</p><p>Reeves added: "I just want to echo what Toby said and thank you all for your tremendous support for The Batman. We could have gotten here without the faith, enthusiasm, and hard work of everyone in this room and your amazing teams here around the world. Every part of this journey has been thrilling for me as a filmmaker and a huge fan of this character, and I'm excited to jump back into this world for the next chapter."</p><p>The title was confirmed on 31st January 2023 to be called <strong>The Batman - Part II</strong>.</p><p>Back in February 2022, Reeves told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Independent</a> that he didn’t create The Batman with a sequel in mind, but that he would like to tell more stories with this iteration of the character.</p><p>“We are already telling other stories in the streaming space, we’re doing stuff on HBO Max, we’re doing a Penguin show with Colin [Farrell], which is gonna be super cool,” Reeves said. “And we’re working on some other stuff too, but we have started talking about another movie."</p><p><strong>We asked a panel of pop-culture enthusiasts the great geek question of our time: </strong><strong>Marvel versus DC – who is the king of superhero cinema?</strong> <a href=#>Watch the full debate show to find out who came out on top.</a></p><p>Speaking exclusively to <a href=# rel=noopener>RadioTimes.com</a> in March, producer Dylan Clark said the creative team "inevitably" had <a href=# rel=noopener>ideas about sequels</a>, but remained relatively tight-lipped about what those ideas might be.</p><p>"Do we have ideas about the sequels? You just inevitably do, because you'll start to say, you know, wouldn't it be cool if... you know, what we haven't seen yet. And, you know, we didn't get enough of Alfred in this movie, or, you know, Gordon's gonna do this in his career. So, you know, with 80 years of Batman in the canon and all these great comics, there are multiple storylines that are just exciting."</p><p>He went on to say that it’s too early to discuss sequel details given that The Batman has just landed in cinemas.</p><p>"We're really focused on making sure this movie gets out in the theatres in the biggest way. And if that happens, and we're rewarded to do a sequel, then we will be the luckiest guys on the planet."</p><p>Fans might have to wait for the sequel to materialise, but fortunately it is confirmed, and we have the HBO Max spinoffs to look forward to in the meantime.</p><p>In 2021, it was announced that HBO Max was developing a prequel series to The Batman that will revolve around Gotham PD.</p><p>And, as mentioned above, there’s also talk of a show exploring Colin Farrell’s Oswald Cobblepot/ Penguin.</p><h2 id=the-batman-part-2-release-date-c75ddb21><strong>The Batman Part 2 release date</strong></h2><p>The Batman - Part II will be released on <strong>3rd October 2025</strong>.</p><p>This film will be independent of James Gunn's plans for the DC cinematic outings, which will include The Brave and the Bold, which focuses on a different iteration of the character alongside his son, Robin/Damian Wayne.</p><p>We will update you further on the release plan for this film when it is released.</p><h2 id=the-batman-part-2-cast-and-character-speculation-cd42604e><strong>The Batman Part 2 cast and character speculation</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2022/03/Batman-Catwoman-8bb583c-be54541.jpeg><p>Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz will be reprising their roles as billionaire socialite Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, and Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, in The Batman 2, it was confirmed at CinemaCon 2022.</p><p>Pattinson recently discussed his intentions for the trilogy.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel=noopener>Empire</a>, Pattinson noted: "I’ve made a kind of map for where Bruce’s psychology would grow over two more movies. I would love to do it."</p><p>He also confirmed that if Warner Bros. was to approach him about reprising his role once or twice more, he wouldn’t hesitate to say yes.</p><p>"I would love to do it," Pattinson said, as producer Dylan Clark added: "As the first stand-alone Batman in 10 years, the hope is we can lay a foundation that you can build stories upon."</p><p>There's also plenty of scope for more character development when it comes to Selina Kyle (Big Little Lies' Zoë Kravitz), who is clearly still developing her alter-ego of Catwoman in The Batman.</p><p>The same goes for detective James Gordon (Westworld’s Jeffrey Wright), who's only a lieutenant in The Batman rather than a Commissioner, as he's more widely known.</p><p>Sadly, John Turturro is unlikely to return as Falcone after he was shot and killed by antagonist The Riddler/Edward Nashton (Paul Dano), and the same goes for Peter Sarsgaard as the late DA Gil Colson.</p><p>However, we wouldn't be surprised if Colin Farrell ends up returning as Penguin for the inevitable sequel and building on his role in the first movie.</p><p>In a recent interview on the <a href=# rel=noopener>Happy, Sad, Confused Podcast</a>, Farrell spoke about his small role.</p><p>"I'm only in it for five or six scenes, so I can't wait to see the film because it won't be ruined by my presence," he said. "Really, it's a freebie for me. I'll get a little bit uncomfortable for the f*****g nine minutes I have, and then the rest of it, I cannot wait to see how [Matt] brought this world to life."</p><p>Following the death of Falcone, Penguin is in a great place to take over Falcone's drug operation in a sequel.</p><p>It's also likely that Dano would reprise his role as The Riddler.</p><p>"If I'm called back to Gotham, I'll be there," Dano recently told <strong>RadioTimes.com</strong> when <a href=# rel=noopener>asked about potential sequels.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2022/03/the-batman-riddler-2041902.jpg><p>Pattinson has also shared which Batman villains he would like to see tackled next in the series.</p><p>"I’d love to do something like Court of Owls," the actor told <a href=# rel=noopener>Den of Geek</a>, adding: "There are elements of The Batman which are kind of horror and I think it really feels quite new for Batman."</p><p>Pattinson has also mentioned the killer Calendar Man as a potential villain, as well as Mr Freeze.</p><p>Reeves recently told <a href=# rel=noopener>Collider</a> that he wanted to do explore a more "grounded" take on Mr Freeze, explaining: "In my view, I just feel drawn to finding the grounded version of everything. So to me it would be a challenge in an interesting way to try and figure out how that could happen, even the idea of something like Mr Freeze, that is such a great story, right?</p><p>"I think there's actually a grounded version of that story, which could be really powerful and could be really great."</p><p>Asked about whether there were any specific comics he'd like to see adapted for a sequel, producer Dylan Clark was rather more vague.</p><p>"I think it's incumbent on us to create new stories that are true to the comics that people know and love," he told <strong>RadioTimes.com</strong>. "So, you know, on this one, Robert read all the comics and there were certain things that we borrowed from multiple storylines.</p><p>"But really, Matt wanted to create a unique way into Batman and create a unique story. And then my hope is that people go, 'Oh, that's from Long Halloween, that's from Year One, is that a little bit of Killing Joke? And is that Arkham Asylum there?' Those things are important to us, but really for us we wanted to do our own story."</p><p class="newsletter-sign-up__disclaimer body-copy-small">By entering your details, you are agreeing to our <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>terms and conditions</a> and <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>privacy policy</a>.
