Per<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12514447/Kate-Middleton-Alexander-McQueen-wedding-dress-Sarah-Burton.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>The Daily Mail</u></a>, Kate is believed to have chosen Sarah Burton to create the dress anticipated around the world after being impressed by the Alexander McQueen gown that fashion journalist Sara Buys wore when she married Tom Parker-Bowles in 2005. (Parker-Bowles, of course, is the son of the then Camilla Parker-Bowles, who also married that year, to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-charles/>Prince Charles</a>; she is now Queen.)</p><p>“Miss Middleton chose British brand Alexander McQueen for the beauty of its craftmanship,” the Palace said in a statement at the time of the wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iBdqguKwDX5Ks5iTf5LeVB-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/poYEp5oxzgZNkLiwvSQoLC-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HF7G8NYu2DfUdbiyGJBuWA-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shnK2DkLvV6bkFrtNWkCyB-1920-80.jpg><p>According to Burton, the gown was a 50/50 collaboration between herself and Kate, who herself was inspired by actress Grace Kelly’s 1956 wedding dress when she wed Prince Rainier of Monaco. Kate visited the “Grace Kelly—Style Icon” exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum the year before her wedding, “and fashion pundits noticed parallels between the two gowns,” The Daily Mail writes.</p><p>Kate’s dress—which featured a Victorian-style corset (which narrowed at the waist and was padded at the hips) underneath a lace bodice—was such a closely guarded secret that Burton didn’t even tell her mother what she was working on. “Even my mum called me and asked me, ‘You wouldn’t tell me, would you?’” Burton said after the April 29 wedding.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBDi3w28RJmcNTLDn7cyW9-1920-80.jpg><p>The lace on the gown was created by the Royal School of Needlework, which cut individual flowers (rose, thistle, daffodil, and shamrock) from antique lace and appliqued them onto ivory silk tulle. “We knew who it was for, but it was very secret,” said embroiderer Amanda Ewing, who was part of the team who made the dress. “We had net curtains up, and cleaners were not allowed into the room, and the code on the door was changed.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

The earrings echo the Middleton family coat of arms and were shaped like oak leaves with a pavé diamond acorn suspended in the middle. Kate’s wedding shoes—size five and a half—were made of ivory duchesse satin and adorned with lace; like the gown, the shoes, too, were crafted by the team at Alexander McQueen.</p><p>“The dress is classic and goes very well in the Westminster décor,” the late Karl Lagerfeld said at the time of the wedding. “It almost reminds me of [Queen] Elizabeth’s wedding, the royal weddings in the ‘50s.” (Well, Her late Majesty married in 1947, but close enough.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k3yD9pYiFgoYG4Vs28T289-1920-80.jpg><p>Per The Daily Mail, Burton joined McQueen straight out of college in 1997. The first question Lee—as McQueen was known—asked Burton was “Do you believe in UFOs?” The pair worked together for 13 years before Lee’s suicide in February 2010; after that, Burton “reluctantly took over the helm,” The Daily Mail writes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiqn66urb%2BOpJitnV2itqWwy56rqKZdrLKlsMinnmacoprAtHnRnqurp6OlsqTAyK%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-most-shocking-celebrity-transformations-of-the-year.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The most shocking celebrity transformations of the year</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rose-wore-a-super-sleek-and-subtly-sexy-slipdress-at-cannes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rose Wore a Super-Sleek and Subtly Sexy Slipdress at Cannes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
