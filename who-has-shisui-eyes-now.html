The eye was implanted within a crow for safe-keeping.<h2>Who took Danzō's eye?</h2>In episode 358, Danzo uses Izanagi against Shisui and steals one of his eyes, meaning Danzo had a Sharingan eye prior to having Shisui's Sharingan eye.<h2>What is special about Shisui eye?</h2>Being thrown into war at quite a young age, Shisui Uchiha awakened his Mangekyo Sharingan before the age of 10, which is a massive feat. His eyes granted the ability of Kotoamatsukami to him and using this power, he could cast a powerful genjutsu capable of manipulating others without them even realizing it.<h2>Who did Itachi have Shisui's eye to?</h2>Itachi gave Shisui's eye to Naruto during the Itachi Pursuit arc. This eye was stuffed in the form of a crow, when Naruto was under Itachi's genjutsu. See below image from Chapter 403, when Naruto is sitting in his room and having a flashback about his encounter with Itachi.<h2>Itachi tells Naruto the truth about Shisui's eye transplanted into his body, English Dubbed [1080p]</h2><p></p><h2>Why didn't Itachi use Shisui's eye for EMS?</h2>Itachi didn't get the eternal mangekyou because he just didn't want to. He did not want to take his father's/anyone else's eyes, because maybe he felt very guilty.<h2>Is Shisui stronger than Danzō?</h2>9 CAN'T BEAT: DANZO SHIMURA<p>Danzo actually attached Shisui and took his eye; Shisui could have easily killed him, however, this would have caused a huge ruckus within the Hidden Leaf and pushed the Leaf towards a certain war.</p><h2>Who has the strongest Susanoo?</h2>1) Hagoromo Otsutsuki<p>Shown as a Susanoo user in the Naruto anime, Hagoromo is undoubtedly the strongest Susanoo user. Manifesting his full-body variant immediately, he could overpower his mother Kaguya in her Ten-tails form.</p><h2>Who is the strongest Sharingan user?</h2><p>Naruto: 14 Strongest Sharingan Users, Ranked</p><ul><li>8 Shisui Uchiha. ...</li><li>7 Itachi Uchiha. ...</li><li>6 Obito Uchiha. ...</li><li>5 Indra Otsutsuki. ...</li><li>4 Madara Uchiha. ...</li><li>3 Kakashi Hatake ( Double Mangekyo Sharingan) ...</li><li>2 Sasuke Uchiha. ...</li><li>1 Hagoromo Otsutsuki.</li></ul><h2>How many eyes did Danzō take?</h2>On the Samurai Bridge, Danzō removes the bandages on his right arm to reveal ten Sharingan eyes embedded on it.<h2>What eye is Danzō?</h2>Danzō's right eye was that of Shisui Uchiha's Sharingan, though, in the anime, Shisui's was not the first Danzō possessed. Nevertheless, he was very skilled at using it, able to detect multiple assassins hidden among his surroundings and subdue individuals with genjutsu.<h2>How does Danzō have Izanagi?</h2>Danzō Shimura receives both Uchiha and Senju implants, allowing him to use Izanagi for one minute. As this is still not very long, he has ten Sharingan implanted in his right arm, giving him up to ten minutes' worth of Izanagi with breaks in between as he chooses.<h2>Did Shisui use Susanoo?</h2>In Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution, Shisui's backstory revealed that he was, in fact, capable of using the Susanoo. While his version of this ability wasn't complete, probably because of having one eye stolen by Danzo, it was still powerful enough to take on a battalion of shinobi.<h2>Is Shisui's Susanoo canon?</h2>Shisui's Susanoo makes its appearance in the video game Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution. In fact, Shisui's Susanoo was designed by Masashi Kishimoto himself. So from that perspective, it is canon.<h2>Who is stronger Shisui or Itachi?</h2>Danzo said shisui was most powerful uchiha in the uchiha clan and itachi was his equal he just didnt surpass him + he was the most talented student in the academy + was selected instead of shisui because of his ability instead of shisui even though shisui has the same openmindedness as itachi.<h2>Who has the green Susanoo?</h2>Shishui Uchiha. Shishui places last since he doesn't show his abilities too often. Shisui's Susanoo is green and has a drill-like spear.<h2>Who has the strongest genjutsu?</h2><p>Top 14 Strongest Genjutsu Users In Naruto</p><ul><li>8 Gengetsu Hozuki. ...</li><li>7 Hashirama Senju. ...</li><li>6 Obito Uchiha. ...</li><li>5 Shisui Uchiha. ...</li><li>4 Itachi Uchiha. ...</li><li>3 Sasuke Uchiha. ...</li><li>2 Madara Uchiha. ...</li><li>1 Kaguya Otsutsuki. Kaguya Otsutsuki is deemed the "Progenitor of Chakra," and she is considered by many to be the strongest being in the entire series.</li></ul><h2>Why is Shisui Susanoo green?</h2>Susanoo Colour | Fandom. If the Susanoos are based on the colours of the rainbow, where: Sasuke = Violet, Madara = Indigo, Obito = Blue, and Shisui = Green, what is Itachi's colour? Because it's shown to be Red, Orange, and Yellow. (I personally think it's Orange, because it's shown the most, I think.)<h2>Who stole Shisui's eye?</h2>In the anime, Danzō arranged a meeting with Shisui and stole his eye after a small scuffle. In the "The Two Uchiha" story, Danzō and Root ambushed Shisui and put him into a corner until Itachi came to his rescue.<h2>Who is Mira Uchiha?</h2>Mira Uchiha (みら うちは, Uchiha Mira) is a surviving member of the Uchiha-Clan. She escaped the Uchiha-massacre thanks to her mother. After that, she started to roam the country and took on various, shady jobs for a living. She does not affiliate herself with any villages.<h2>Who is Shin's father?</h2>Shin's Dad was a Human carpenter residing in Hole along with his son working as ordinary people, his wife was a Magic User killed by the Militia just after Shin was born.<h2>Can Shisui Uchiha Teleport?</h2>Shisui had one of the fastest body flicker techniques around. He was literally so fast it looked like he was teleporting.<h2>Can Shisui beat Sasuke?</h2>Shisui would be too fast for any of Sasuke's long-range attacks. He'd close the distance and probably end it with Kotoamatsukami. Sasuke would win a Susanoo-off, but they can't keep that up forever. When it gets down to CQC, it's over.<h2>How many times can Shisui use Kotoamatsukami?</h2>Once Kotoamatsukami has been used, it cannot be activated from that eye again for ten years. Shisui first awakened his Mangekyou Sharingan at a young age as a member of Root but having died in his twenties, he never even had the chance to use the genjutsu more than four times in total.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmagkah6tLTIrKyiZZWusrR5zaiu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-a-koala-keeps-showing-up-in-star-trek-including-on-this-week-s-strange-new-worlds.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why A Koala Keeps Showing Up In Star Trek, Including On This Weeks Strange New Worlds</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tinubu-reverses-nigeria-to-old-national-anthem-details-emerge.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tinubu Reverses Nigeria to Old National Anthem, Details Emerge</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
