So, what is the name of the biggest hotel in Nigeria? Answer: this place is called the Federal Palace Hotel, and it is a truly remarkable tourist attraction, which we will tell you about today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3f9928bdc8df040f.jpg><p class=align-left>Photo: booking.com</p><h3>Everything about the Federal Palace Hotel</h3><p class=align-left>The Federal Palace Hotel, which is the biggest hotel in Nigeria and the most popular one, is situated in the commercial area of Victoria Island, the Lagos location. This hotel was established in 1960 and was intended to be the premier international hotel of Nigeria. Originally, this place was owned by the Victoria Beach Hotel, and was a part of the trading group “A.G. Leventis”. It is considered to be one of the main landmarks of the Lagos metropolis. One of the reasons why this hotel is so famous is closely related to Nigeria’s history. The Federal Palace Hotel has been the setting for Nigeria’s Declaration of Independence signing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt572v8uqj952.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 most developed cities in Nigeria in 2018</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since 2007, this hotel is a property of the company “Sun International”. This company is mostly known for founding the Sun City Resort in South-African North-West Province, Rustenburg. This company, specialized in entertainment, gaming, and hospitality, was created in 1969 when Sol Kerzner joined forces with the South African Breweries, and together they started Southern Sun Hotel Company.</p><p class=align-left>1960 was the year when Nigeria finally gained independence from Great Britain, and this event coincided with the building and construction of a brand new Federal Palace Hotel. So, it was decided that the declaration, which is so important for Nigerian citizens, will be signed in the boardroom of the newly constructed hotel. Nowadays, because of its high historical value, the boardroom of the hotel is known as one of the main features of this place. Furthermore, the official celebration of the Nigerian independence also took place in the Federal Palace Hotel, more accurately in the hotel’s so-called Independence Hall. Except that, this hall hosted the Heads of State summit for the African Union in 1977, as well as the FESTAC (Festival of African Arts and Culture). The hall of the Federal Palace Hotel has been through a lot, and today, it is the most notable place which the guests of the hotel can view and be proud of.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5e8vbmiloin.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Which are the best cities in Nigeria?
