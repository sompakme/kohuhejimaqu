Takeoff's passing was truly shocking, and Offset was never able to give his friend a proper goodbye. Although, he recently got to honor the man by dedicating his entire back to Takeoff. In a recent Instagram post, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Offset unveiled his new backpiece tattoo,</a> which is an intricate portrait of Takeoff. It was an incredible gesture that showcases his love for the man. Unfortunately, Quavo doesn't seem to approve.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-quavo-takes-to-instagram>Quavo Takes To Instagram</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the Instagram post above, Quavo could be seen standing on top of a plane. In the caption to the post, he wrote "Rocket Power It's In You, Not On You!" If you know anything about Takeoff, his solo album was called The Last Rocket. Moreover, Quavo plans on naming his album Rocket Power, which is a reference to the late rapper. Needless to say, you can see how fans are saying that this seems to be a not-so-subtle diss. "Offset tattoo diss," one commenter wrote. "Disappointing and unnecessary caption unc," said another.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I hope this isn’t a subliminal message," another commenter then added. "Set loves Take so it’s in him AND on him. You said you would ask yourself, “What would Take do?” Do you think he would be out here beefing with Set?" Needless to say, fans are not co-signing any of this. However, there is not much the fans can say to bring this beef to a close. Both sides have their own views on what went down. Although it is unfortunate, it is going to take a lot for both sides to mend it.
