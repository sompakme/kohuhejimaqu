It has an aerodynamic function, allowing for smooth airflow to be provided to riders when they duck in over a long straight stretch. During a high-side accident, it functions as a safety device that helps passengers escape injury.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>“Why is Rossi referred to as the doctor?”</h3><p>Rossi has gone by the moniker “The Doctor” since he began dominating the 500 cc and MotoGP classes. According to others, this may be due to his “cold and clinical demolition of his opponents,” as well as his cool and serene serenity in racing, as opposed to his frenzied days in 125 cc and 250 cc, when his performance was unpredictable and hazardous.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><h3>When did the MotoGP switch to four-stroke engines?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>2002,</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Who was it that Valentino Rossi killed?</h3><p>Marco Simoncelli is a musician from Italy.</p><p></p><h3>What is the height of Scott Redding?</h3><p>1.84 metres in height</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the reason behind BMW’s absence from MotoGP?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>BMW does not have a dedicated factory racing division, indicating that racing is not their main focus.

The 125 cc class was phased out in favour of the Moto3 class in 2012. This class is confined to single-cylinder four-stroke engines having a displacement of 250 cc and a bore of no more than 81 mm (3.2 inches).

Overall, I would argue that MotoGP is more risky than Formula One, but neither is completely safe, and both contain dangers that are effectively handled – so it is more dangerous, but not much more so.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3>Who do you think is the greatest MotoGP rider of all time?</h3><p>The Top Ten Most Outstanding MotoGP Riders of All Time 1 Valentino Rossi is a professional motorcycle racer.

Casey Stoner is number three. Unlike anybody else, he can ride like no other! 4th place goes to Jorge Lorenzo. Giacomo Agostini is the fifth member of the group.

Rossi’s appetite for racing, on the other hand, seems to have remained unabated, despite his dismal performances last season.
