While advising people to avoid "evil mists and rotten fruit" might sound odd today, it's a reflection on where medical knowledge was in 16th Century.</p><p>Caius wrote: "This disease is not a Sweat only (as it is thought and called), but a fever … in the spirits by putrefaction venomous. First by the pain in the back or shoulder, pain in the extreme parts, as arm, or leg. Secondly by the grief in the liver and stomach. Thirdly by the pain in the head, & madness. Fourthly by the passion of the heart.</p><p>"Whereupon also follows a heaviness, (the fifth token of this disease), and a desire to sleep, never contented, the senses in all parts being as they were bound or closed up. Last follows the short abidings, a certain token of the disease."</p><p>He also advised people to exercise frequently and that, in the early stages of the illness, one must drink herbal mixtures and avoid being outside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/2nOUW-QjnC559WUkZltCM2h5JF4=/16x24/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/I7W5F5MZN4SXJVUU4FIZCCAFGU.jpg"><h3 class=article__heading>WHERE DID THE SWEAT COME FROM?</h3><p>It's not clear who first contracted sweating sickness, but there's a theory held by some historians that the disease came to England via a group of French soldiers King Henry VII's father had hired to secure the throne for him and his son in 1487 and end the Wars of the Roses.</p><p>Whether the mercenaries actually brought sweating sickness to England will never be known but one theory is that the illness was first heard of at the Battle of Bosworth, and then followed the King's men back to London where 15,000 people died from the disease in six weeks.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>There were five known epidemics of the Sweat — in 1485, 1508, 1517, 1528, and 1551.</p><p>While the disease was mostly contained in England, the outbreak in 1528 managed to kill 2,000 in London before the sickness travelled via passengers on a ship to Hamburg, Germany, where more than a thousand deaths occurred in four weeks.</p><p>A further 3,000 people died in Danzig and Lübeck before the illness spread to Scandinavia, Denmark and Russia. The disease managed to totally bypass Italy and most of France (apart from Calais in the north.)</p><p>King Henry's printer Richard Grafton referred to the sweating sickness as a new kind of sickness. Grafton wrote of the illness: "So sore, so painful, and sharp, that the like was never heard of to any man's remembrance before that time."</p><p>It says a lot about the severity of the Sweat when you consider that the people who've written about how horrendous it was, were people that had also seen the horrors of the Black Death.</p><p>But while the Sweat was undoubtedly frightening, it wasn't quite as devastating as the Black Death, in terms of mortality rates.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The bubonic plague swept across England between 1346 and 1353, killing more than 20 million people (about 60 per cent of the population). One factor that set the Sweat apart from the Black Death was that the former was puzzling from beginning to end while the mystery of the bubonic plague was solved when it was discovered to be spread by infected fleas from small animals, such as rats.</p><h3 class=article__heading>KING HENRY VIII WAS PARANOID ABOUT CATCHING THE SWEAT</h3><p>According to author Alison Weir, King Henry VIII was said to be terrified of the Sweat and he demanded to be moved around England in a bid to escape the spread of the disease.</p><p>The King had good reason to be scared, as the disease was spreading like wildfire and seemed to be favouring the well-to-do. Weir writes that King Henry fled London with his Queen and a group of people, including his mistress Anne Boleyn.</p><p>"In June 1528 the sweating sickness returned to plague London and, later on, the rest of the country. This was a particularly virulent outbreak and the King, learning with horror that some members of his household had succumbed to the disease fled to another house and then another after that, until he was sleeping in a different place each night."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/OG2K2FT1znc11mL1crZxIa2mDjQ=/16x23/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/VTFHS7A2JWVY75O3KU3MYXL3HU.jpg"><h3 class=article__heading>THE WORST EPIDEMIC</h3><p>In 1485 physician Thomas Forrestier wrote several accounts of the Sweat after witnessing his patients succumb to the illness and also this account of simply being out in the streets at the time of the epidemic.</p><p>"We saw two priests standing together and speaking together, and saw both of them die suddenly. Also we saw the wife of a tailor suddenly die. Another young man walking by the street fell down suddenly. Also another gentleman riding out of the city died. Also many other which were to rehearse we have known that have died suddenly."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/7pAooDv3H6t1TMmNv4uUZcnKAyo=/16x24/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/PQ6X2I6OB5DLHMNBUGE5UV6EZI.jpg"><h3 class=article__heading>MORE THEORIES</h3><p>The jury is still out on what caused the Sweat. Some modern researchers have proposed that it was caused by the hantavirus infection which is transmitted by certain mice, rats, and voles. The symptoms of the Sweat are said to be similar to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.</p><p>Other scientists believe anthrax might have been the cause: during the bioterrorism attacks of 2001 that resulted in five deaths, one of the major symptoms was copious sweating. Others believe the Sweat might have been a version of the flu or a sickness known as 'relapsing fever'. Whatever its origins, the Sweat carried the same kind of terror that the Ebola virus carried today.</p><p>Henry Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, died during the Sweat epidemic of 1551 — his body was buried in a cemetery that still exists. While it's possible to exhume his remains and search for hantavirus, scientists say it's unlikely the genetic material has survived and so there are no immediate plans to disturb the Duke's remains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/5xH-KewjrYaS7WHMdA0P_z9uAtI=/16x10/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/WFCLTKSIJWTGNY6F22CN4YWIAM.jpg"><h3 class=article__heading>THE END OF THE SCOURGE</h3><p>In 1551 the Sweat stopped as suddenly as it began. A similar illness known as the "Picardy Sweat" occurred 150 years later in France, but that sickness came and went very quickly, making it virtually impossible for scientists to compare the two 'sweaty' diseases.</p><p>Also, thanks to slack record keeping, nobody really knows exactly how many people died from the Sweat although clearly thousands lost their lives. All historians have to rely on is scattered, vague health records and personal diaries.</p><p>And while Anne Boleyn didn't manage to survive her marriage to King Henry VIII, she was rumoured to have contracted the dreaded sweating sickness and come out of the scourge alive.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmsKeiobFwwMeeZJ2dkZm5unnSsJyarJmjtG6%2FyJyip52jqHq1tMCtZK2doqe2p7XEnWSkoZ6ceqmxzauwZq6ZnrZwjZKEiISJcYGDhZ2nkIOJkmSMkXScp4h%2FfIVf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./transcript-joyce-vance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Transcript: Joyce Vance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-landon-jr-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Landon Jr Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
