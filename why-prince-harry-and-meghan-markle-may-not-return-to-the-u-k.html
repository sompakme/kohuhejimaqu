The prince has also previously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>cited their lack of proper protection as a driving force</a> behind their decision to take a step back from royal duties. Authorities have since removed their right to security, and in December 2023, Harry and his lawyers argued against the court's verdict. Now, High Court judge Peter Lane has doubled down on the ruling made by the U.K. government and the&nbsp;Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (RAVEC), which, in turn, could mean that the Sussexes will not be visiting the U.K. as a family anytime soon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The court has found that there has not been any unlawfulness in reaching the decision of 28 February 2020," the judge said in documents obtained by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "The decision was not irrational. The decision was not marred by procedural unfairness."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The court has also found that there has been no unlawfulness on the part of RAVEC in respect of its arrangements for certain of the claimant’s visits to Great Britain," Lane added.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harry's legal team confirmed to People that the prince plans to appeal the ruling. “The Duke is not asking for preferential treatment, but for a fair and lawful application of RAVEC’s own rules, ensuring that he receives the same consideration as others in accordance with RAVEC’s own written policy," his legal spokesperon said in a statement. "In February 2020, RAVEC failed to apply its written policy to The Duke of Sussex and excluded him from a particular risk analysis. The Duke’s case is that the so-called 'bespoke process' that applies to him is no substitute for that risk analysis."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The Duke of Sussex hopes he will obtain justice from the Court of Appeal and makes no further comment while the case is ongoing," they added. Harry even offered to fund the security at the time. However, that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>request was also denied</a>.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>December 2023 statement</a> to the High Court, Harry explained why it was vital for his family to receive protection while in the U.K., adding that his children will not be able to experience his "home" if they are not granted security.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The U.K. is my home. The U.K. is central to the heritage of my&nbsp;children&nbsp;and a place I want them to feel at home as much as where they live at the moment in the&nbsp;United States," he said. "That cannot happen if there is no possibility to keep them safe when they are on U.K. soil."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can't put my wife in danger like that, and given my experiences in life, I'm reluctant to unnecessarily put myself in harm's way too," Harry added.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqisq6xdp8Kttc2gZKydk6q%2FqsDYZqeroZ6Ysm60wKupsmWdmrSprc1mpJqqm6GyboSVaWhtcGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-classic-fashion-pieces-every-woman-should-own.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 classic fashion pieces every woman should own</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-riley-roberts-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-s-fianc%C3%A9.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Riley Roberts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Fianc?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
