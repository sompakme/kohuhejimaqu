They also often require commitment, with a course of regular appointments offering better results than a single clinic visit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There’s a healthy middle ground with lasers as effective treatments for long-term skin health,” explains facialist Debbie Thomas. She may be one of the beauty industry’s laser authorities, but she takes a slow and steady approach. “By building up strong, robust skin, visible signs of ageing slow down,” she says.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How do laser facials work?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are about 10 lasers that are used for skin treatments, and while they all work in a similar way, they have different abilities. “Lasers are extremely popular devices used in many cosmetic skin practices, providing both medical and aesthetic benefits,” explains consultant dermatologist <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dranjalimahto.co.uk data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Anjali Mahto" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr. Anjali Mahto</a>. “They work by firing a very narrow beam of light, where all of the light waves generated have a similar wavelength. Target molecules in the skin, known as chromophores, will absorb this light and convert it into heat to generate a desired effect.” This effect may be to reduce blood vessels (and the accompanying redness), fade pigmentation, remove unwanted hair (see more on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a26085141/laser-hair-removal/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="laser hair removal, here" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">laser hair removal, here</a>), or to resurface the skin to reduce the appearance of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a28504870/how-to-get-rid-of-acne-scars/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="acne scars" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">acne scars</a> or fine lines.<br></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The laser treatment sub-types</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When looking into laser facials, you’ll likely see various treatments described as either ‘ablative’ or ‘non-ablative’. The basic difference here is that an ablative laser will remove the upper layer of the skin. Non-ablative lasers leave the epidermis intact, bypassing it to directly tackle the dermis beneath. While ablative lasers are usually considered more effective, they traditionally require more recovery, or ‘downtime’, after a treatment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So far, so simple – but things do get a little more complex. “To sub-divide lasers further, both ablative and non-ablative lasers can be ‘fractional’, says Dr. Mahto. “Fractional lasers have been around since the early 2000s; they target the skin by delivering laser energy where the laser beam has been divided into many small, deep columns. These areas are known as microthermal treatment zones (MTZs). Fractional lasers have a faster recovery time than 'non-fractional' lasers, as the entire bulk of tissue has not been treated.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: Trialling a Sarah Chapman facial" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2020-01-16-at-12-27-22-1579177668.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The skin issues that laser facials treat</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Choosing the right laser for the right patient requires experience in dermatology to make the right diagnosis, as well as clinical skill in creating a bespoke plan and performing the treatment,” feels Dr. Mahto.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr. Ifeoma Ejikeme – medical consultant skin expert and founder of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.adoniamedicalclinic.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Adonia Medical Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Adonia Medical Clinic</a> – agrees, adding that "customisation is essential to achieve optimal results and avoid complications".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below is a generalised guide to the key types of laser, and the skin issues they primarily treat – although bear in mind that many types of laser can work across multiple skin types and issues.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Laser facials for redness and rosacea</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Vascular lasers such as a pulse-dye or Nd:Yag can be used to target redness and thread veins of the face,” says Dr. Mahto. They emit a beam of pure yellow light, which is absorbed by the skin and converted into heat that reduces broken veins and those associated with rosacea.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Laser facials for hyperpigmentation and dark spots</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lasers such as the fast and powerful Q-switched Nd:Yag and the Alexandrite can be used for the treatment of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a37685934/hyperpigmentation-treatments/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=hyperpigmentation class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">hyperpigmentation</a> such as sun spots. However, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) can occur in response to inflammation in the skin after laser treatments, particularly in darker skin types, so it's imperative to only visit experienced practitioners who can choose the best technology and approach for you.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition, when using these powerful lasers, “it is important that the practitioner is certain that the spot being zapped is truly pigmentation and not an early skin cancer such as a lentigo maligna”, says Dr. Mahto. “I have certainly first-hand seen patients being treated elsewhere for a pigmented lesion which has turned out to be a skin cancer due to the inexperience of the person offering the treatment.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Laser facials for texture and tone</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is where ablative lasers come in. Carbon dioxide (commonly called the ‘carbon peel’) and Erbium are generally considered the lasers of choice for resurfacing the skin to improve overall skin texture and tone, as well as for scarring – be it from acne, trauma or surgery. “They work by boosting the production of new collagen in the skin over time to provide the skin with support and structure,” explains Dr. Mahto.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Do laser facials hurt?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There might be some mild discomfort during the procedure, such as a warm sensation or slight stinging," says Dr. Ejikeme. Expect anything from a pricking feeling to a sensation like the flick of an elastic band or a small electric shock. "However, the intensity of this sensation can vary depending on the type of laser used and individual pain tolerance," she adds. And know that laser treatments are generally fast, so you aren’t ever uncomfortable for very long.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Laser facials: the downtime</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The reason that many experts prefer to perform gentler laser treatments over multiple sessions is because everyone repairs and regenerates differently. “The problem with aggressive treatments is that if you’re someone who doesn’t heal that well you could end up with long-term damage,” Thomas explains.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The facialist says that around 85 per cent of her clients leave the clinic without any redness. However, whether your skin looks ‘normal’ or not it will be stimulated, so you must practice sensible laser aftercare.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I tell my clients to imagine they’ve got a severe sunburn for three days. Think: ‘Would I sit in a sauna? Would I take a really hot shower? Would I scrub my skin?’ You know intuitively what you wouldn’t. What you would do, however, is soothe and hydrate the skin, and that’s exactly what you should do post-laser.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Similarly, Dr. Mahto highlights the importance of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/g38180/best-face-spf/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="rigorous sun protection" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">rigorous sun protection</a> following a laser skin treatment, as the skin will be hyper-sensitive to UV light. “I personally prefer to do more invasive treatments in the autumn or winter months on my patients,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr. Mahto also recommends scaling back your skincare post-laser – especially if you have maximalist predilections. “Avoiding acid exfoliants and retinoids can be of benefit depending on the type of treatment you have had: your practitioner will be able to give you more specific advice prior to therapy commencing. Non-smokers often fare better than those who smoke, as smoking can impair wound healing.”</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The best laser facials to try now</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, see some of London's best laser facial treatments, recommended by the Bazaar beauty team.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>DNA Laser Complete Grade 2 at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://dthomas.com/our-treatments/#laser-light data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="D.Thomas Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">D.Thomas Clinic</a>: </strong>Debbie Thomas' hero treatment, this non-invasive skin rejuvenation is suitable for all skin tones to treat hyperpigmentation, acne and/or rosacea, and overall age management.
