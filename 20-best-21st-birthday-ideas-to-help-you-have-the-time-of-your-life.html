Set up this game to test your friend's understanding of how well they know you.</p><h3>3. Go for a weekend gateway</h3><p class=align-left>If your birthday falls on a weekend, why not plan for a weekend gateway? Take a trip to a new town just for a couple of days. If you have travelled as a large group, rent out waterfront properties for maximum fun.</p><h3>4.
