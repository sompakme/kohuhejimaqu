When they both returned, they did not pursue their relationship further.<h2>Does Willow become evil?</h2>In her place was Dark Willow, who possessed no morals and only cared about one thing: revenge. Xander managed to stop her, but not before Willow tried to destroy the world. Afterward, Willow recovered from her turn to evil in England with Giles, who helped her to control her magic.<h2>Who was Buffy true love?</h2>Buffy the Last Vampire Slayer #4 by Casey Gilly, Joe Jaro, and Joana Lafuente quietly positions Spike as Buffy's one true final love -- and while it doesn't cement their relationship, it does imply that Spike is the ultimate victor of his rivalry with Angel for her heart.<h2>Does Xander become a vampire?</h2>Xander then sacrificed his soul back to her and seemingly disappeared. But while his friends grieved for him, he had actually become a full-blown vampire, just like Spike wanted, and was underneath Sunnydale becoming the leader of a large group of demons and fellow vamps.<h2>Does Buffy ever see Spike again in Angel?</h2>The season 5 premiere of Angel welcomes Buffy regular Spike into the fold when he's resurrected after literally going out in a blaze of glory in the Buffy series finale.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxll565pr%2BMpZyarpVir7ayxbJkn6eiYrSwu8M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harvey-keitel-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Harvey Keitel Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cardi-b-explains-why-it-bothers-her-when-fans-call-her-mexican.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cardi B Explains Why It Bothers Her When Fans Call Her Mexican</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
