Speaking on <a class=hm-link href=#>The Today Show</a>, the star revealed that the couple are not “accepting” of Ramona, and that they are both hoping that it will change in due course. She explained: “Ramona was born in Latvia, and it's not as LGBTQ+-friendly as other countries are. There are still parts of the world that aren't as accepting.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a4d65e659f85-rebel-wilson-ramona-courtside.jpg><p id=eApgIacz4xI data-wc=63>Rebel, 44, continued to say that her young son Royce was making things easier: “I'm really excited to meet them because I know they are very smart. Ramona's mother is a doctor. Roycie is the real icebreaker. They've been FaceTiming with her.” Chatting on Desert Island Discs, she revealed that her family had been accepting of her relationship but Ramona’s had not. “</p><p id=evkU_0ot0m data-wc=22>“Her mum has luckily come around now,” she explained. “Her father still doesn't talk to her, but we're hoping that will change.”</p><h3>How Rebel and Ramona met</h3><p id=eL6QJd1g0_c data-wc=94>The pair met back in 2022, getting engaged one year later in 2023. The actress came out as gay on Instagram with a photo of herself with her partner, writing: “I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess.” Chatting to People about how they met, she explained: “We spoke on the phone for weeks before meeting. And that was a really good way to get to know each other. It was a bit old-school in that sense — very romantic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0ac654096852-rebel-wilson-daughter.jpg><p id=eYZ4DzVs_gfY data-wc=81>“I think going through the process of finding more self-worth, I think that what you want in a partner is elevated and so it’s great to have someone who feels like an equal partner and be in a healthy relationship. There were times — I’m not saying with all my exes, they’re great — but there were some times that I was probably putting up with that I shouldn’t have. So it feels different to be in a really healthy relationship.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Rebel's baby daughter</h3><p id=eMmg-HeC7Iwu data-wc=48>Rebel and Ramona co-parent baby Royce, one. Speaking about telling Ramona that she was expecting a baby, she said: “I'd already been planning to use a surrogate to have a child and I'd done several rounds of IVF and I had one embryo transfer, which sadly didn't work.</p><p id=eCcoo2rROdf9 data-wc=64>“Almost right at meeting Ramona, I was planning on the second embryo transfer and I was like, 'Babe I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm going to have a child kind of around November'. Ramona just looked at me and said, 'Well, I love you and if you have a child, I'm going to love your child exactly the same way.’”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Rebel Wilson reveals challenging reason she hasn't met her future in-laws" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/680485df0ae0-gettyimages-2153347173.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Rebel Wilson reveals challenging reason she hasn't met her future in-laws" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Rebel Wilson reveals challenging reason she hasn't met her future in-laws</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meet the LGBTQ mums and dads and their adorable children: From Elton John to Tom Daley" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f84dd903f633-lgbtq-parents.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meet the LGBTQ mums and dads and their adorable children: From Elton John to Tom Daley" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meet the LGBTQ mums and dads and their adorable children: From Elton John to Tom Daley</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eP-IOMQFidAS data-wc=44>The star announced baby Royce’s arrival in November 2022 on Instagram, writing: “Beyond proud to announce the birth of my first child, Royce Lillian, born this past week via surrogate.
