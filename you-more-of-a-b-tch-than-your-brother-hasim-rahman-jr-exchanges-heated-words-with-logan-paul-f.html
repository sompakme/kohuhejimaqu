The current farce began with a tweet lamenting Paul’s victory over a much older opponent since he always chooses to fight over his own age. <strong>Logan Paul</strong>, his older brother, is appeared in the scene to defend his little brother from all of the criticism.</p><p><a href=#>Jake Paul</a> made history last Saturday when he triumphed over <strong>one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time</strong>. With the victory, <strong>the 25-year-career old’s</strong> shines brighter than ever as his unbeaten record still stands. Despite the boxers’ <strong>22-year age difference</strong>, the bout had all the characteristics of a major heavyweight title fight since fans around the world witnessed one of the greatest fights in history.</p><p>The drama surrounding the most awaited bout in recent times has created a new wave. Few people believe it and criticize Paul for exploiting age disparities. They said the YouTuber-turned-boxer had been fighting older opponents on purpose since the beginning. Many people believe the reasons for his career’s success. His older brother, on the other hand, intervenes to defend his little brother.</p><p>It all started with a tweet that showed the famous photograph of a crying<strong> LeBron James</strong>. which was taken from the <strong>NBA finals of 2016</strong>, widely regarded as one of the best in the game’s history. Long story short, Logan tried to protect his brother with his previous record after seeing the age-critical tweet. which says, “Jake Paul is crying after beating yet another 40-year-old retired man instead of fighting someone his age.”</p><p>https://twitter.com/Loctioo/status/1586579430104768515?s=20&t=3kBqSOS-74G9Qm9ZeBSQsA</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jake tried to fight two boxers this year on separate occasions (Tommy Fury, 23 years old, 8-0, AND Hasim Rahman JR, 31 year old, 12-1) and they BOTH BACKED OUT.</p><p>A combat legend was the only one willing to take the challenge. Shut the fuck up <a href=#>https://t.co/Dpadf7zth1</a></p><p>— Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 30, 2022</a></p><p>Later, <strong>Hashim Rahman Jr.</strong>, the son of <strong>former heavyweight champion Hashim Rahman</strong>, joined the party, contradicting Logan’s claims that he had backpedaled from a battle against the younger Paul. Both sides condemn the other for pulling out first by not adhering to the agreed-upon weight requirements.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I didn’t back out, your brother cancelled the fight.</p><p>But you and I weigh the same thing, stay on hush mode like you do when we in person.🤫</p><p>Mf goes 🫡 when he see me after saying it’s on sight, then gets in front of 🎥 and pop shit.

Paul has previously fought six times and is undefeated. The boxing career began with the <strong>Paul vs. AnEsonGib</strong> battle, which took place when AnEsonGib was <strong>24 years old</strong>. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Aside from him, all of his opponents</a> are over 30, and the majority are over 35. which may suggest age criticism, but it’s not quite that simple. because all of the fighters require an agreement prior to the bout, where the age problem is raised. However, it was their free will to fight Jake, and he indeed earned the outcome, <strong>as it was 6-0</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmsqelYrqwvsRmpp9lkWKvta%2FHZquhmZ5ixrDB0WaZq6eknbKzeceaqqKlXaeuqbnAp2Sjql2axaS0wKeenqtdnbKiwMSdZLCnopnAbsPIrZ9mpJ%2Bcrq95z5qspWWWpLmtu9aipaBlmpa4pnnPmqylq12rtqTAzquwZqemmr9urc2dnKurn6N6tLXLr5ho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./23-of-holly-willoughby-s-most-memorable-dancing-on-ice-gowns-revealed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>23 of Holly Willoughby's most memorable Dancing on Ice gowns revealed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-marco-simoncelli-helmet-come-off.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why did Marco Simoncelli helmet come off?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-cool-cars-in-kanye-west-s-multimillion-dollar-garage-including-a-maybach-lamborghini-and-an-as.html>5 Cool Cars in Kanye Wests Multimillion-Dollar Garage, Including a Maybach, Lamborghini and an As</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-jones-sequin-zara-trousers-cause-a-mass-sellout.html>Alex Jones' sequin Zara trousers cause a mass sellout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anthony-kim-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Kim Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dylan-lauren-net-worth-2024.html>Dylan Lauren Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-far-is-kentucky-to-texas.html>How Far Is Kentucky To Texas</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash.
